Samsung SMX-K45 Up-scaling HDMI Camcorder with 32 GB SSD Flash Drive with 52x Optical Zoom (Blue) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),,"Color: Blue From the Manufacturer With Samsung's new K-Series camcorders, you can enjoy near full-HD quality video for the price of a standard definition camcorder. The SMX-K45 records exceptional standard definition video at a resolution of 720 x 480, and then can be played back on an HDTV in near full-HD quality thanks to advanced upscaling technology and HDMI connectivity. With a built-in HDMI output on the camera and HDMI cable (sold separately), simply connect the camcorder directly to an HDTV for near full-HD playback. The SMX-K45 also offer ones of Samsung's most powerful zoom lenses. You have a 65x Intelli-Zoom at their fingertips which drastically enhances the ability to capture any moment, no matter how far away you may be. Significantly more reliable than a standard digital zoom, which negatively affects the quality of the image, Samsung's new Intelli-Zoom allows you to go beyond the camcorder's 52x optical zoom. The K-Series also features Samsung's advanced Optical Image Stabilizer, ensuring that video will be shake-free, whether zoomed out or using the camcorder at it's full 65x Intelli-Zoom. Furthermore, the camcorder's world class Schneider-KREUZNACH lens delivers the quality and performance needed to help capture the most impressive video possible. The SMX-K45 offers an internal 32GB Solid State Drive (SSD), providing up to 20 hours and 40 minutes of recording time depending on the recording mode. Samsung's renowned SSD technology offers a substantial advantage over the use of Hard Disk Drives (HDD) in a digital camcorder. SSD is more energy efficient, produces very low heat emission, and is faster and more durable than HDD because there are no moving parts. The new SMX-K45 follows in the footsteps of the SMX-C14 and SMX-C10 and boasts several unique features which differentiate them from the competition and make video recording even more enjoyable. Such features include Samsung's built-in intelli-studio software, animated thumbnails, and a versatile charging system. No longer do you need to worry about being near a computer in order to edit or share video. The K-Series all feature Samsung's play-edit-sharing program called intelli studio. The built-in intelli-studio program allows you to turn any computer into a mobile studio, offering the ability to edit and play video without having to install supporting software. Sharing is also simplified using intelli-studio as the program takes the hassle out of uploading content to popular video sharing Web sites. Samsung's animated thumbnail feature simplifies the way users search for video clips. Each video clip saved on the camcorder is represented by a small thumbnail on the LCD screen. When scrolling through one's videos, each thumbnail will provide a short playback of the video file when highlighted by the user. The SMX-K45 also features a versatile charging system. Recharge the battery by simply connecting the camcorder to the supplied AC adapter or via USB while the camcorder is connected to a computer.",data storage
