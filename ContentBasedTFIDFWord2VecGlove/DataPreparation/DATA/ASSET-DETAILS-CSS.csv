1,"Peter Drucker, the legendary management scholar and consultant, noted in a 1994 Harvard Business Review article that the assumptions businesses make—about customer behaviors, competitors, and markets—constitute their theory of business.1 The theory that a company develops, dictates what it should do and how it should do it, and can be a powerful tool to guide the enterprise.
However, when those assumptions no longer reflect reality, the decisions a company makes that once led to profitability can lead it astray. The failure to change the theory (and the assumptions that undergird it) to align with the new reality, Drucker wrote, is at the root of all business crises.
Today, because customer behaviors, markets, and competitors have all changed, and continue to change rapidly, business theories do not reflect reality for very long. This is why so many companies, especially those most affected by the digitization of everything, are in crisis. It is why they need to revise their theories of business to become smarter, faster, and lighter.
The Revolution in Customer Behavior
How much have business theories changed over this decade? Look at one aspect of customer behavior—the shopping patterns of consumers. Just a few years ago, when a shopper entered a store, his or her choice was limited to what was on the shelves. Today, armed with smart mobile devices, enabled by free, pervasive WiFi, a customer in Store A can:

Compare the price and quality of what is on the shelves with an entire universe of competing products

Obtain instant reviews of products from social media channels

Text friends about their experiences with the products, or ask trusted strangers in online consumer forums

Purchase the product from Store B while standing in Store A’s aisle


This complex path to purchase promises to grow more varied, not less. According to a 2014 study, 22% of shoppers interacted digitally prior to shopping. While only 4% used a digital device during the shopping process, 75% said they planned to do so in the near future.2 Just one year later, U.S. car buyers spent 60% of their time purchasing a vehicle doing online research. By the time they went to a dealer, 71% decided to buy the car they intended to purchase. If companies want to influence the customer’s purchase, they need to do it much earlier in the so-called customer journey.3
A theory of business based on a static, linear customer journey, or one that prescribes a rigid customer experience, no longer reflects reality.
The Digitally Shifting Competitive Landscape
Traditionally, a company’s growth strategy was to become the market leader in its core market segments, and then protect that position against competitors. But that does not account for the fact that competitors now emerge from different segments. In 2001, for example, Nokia was the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It had a robust, well-funded R&D function, and seemingly unassailable scale. In 2004, it still had over a third of the market.4
After Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 and Google’s Android operating system came online the next year, Nokia’s theory of the business became instantly obsolete.
Nokia was not defeated by another cell phone maker. It lost market share to a computer company and an online firm. Apple and Google developed technologies with an ecosystem that used the network effect, which made them valuable in the eyes of the consumers.5
A theory of business that fails to account for competitors emerging from entirely different sectors of the economy no longer reflects the reality of global competition. Due to powerful and fast-evolving technologies, easy access to capital, and lower barriers to entry, companies need to look beyond their segments and geographies to keep a weather eye out for fast-emerging competitors.
The Metamorphosis of Markets
Nokia’s size did not protect it. Indeed, scale, long an axiomatic part of strategies designed to dominate markets, has become less important and sometimes burdensome. In part, this is due to the increasing power of emerging markets. By 2025, it is estimated that developing economies could account for nearly 70% of global demand for manufactured goods.6
Increasingly, this shift in demand is forcing companies to personalize their offerings for markets by focusing on regional production, as have been the strategies of IKEA, P&G, Emerson, and others. This new reality can be seen clearly in the pharmaceutical sector. Large regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medical Agency have been promulgating faster approvals of new, personalized medicines for unmet medical needs in small patient populations. To take advantage of these new pathways, drug developers must be able to respond rapidly to guidance from regulators.
Smaller, more agile companies, unburdened by outdated workflows and less top-heavy, can make faster decisions and take advantage of regulator input more quickly than larger companies.
These small companies, with one or two drugs in their pipelines, can achieve enormous market valuations in short times. They move faster because they are much lighter organizations than big pharma.
How to Get Smarter, Faster, and Lighter
How can companies change their theories of business to become smarter, faster, and lighter at the speed of these digitally driven transformations? We explain how to do it in the three sections of this edition of Perspectives.
Getting Smarter
One of the themes of this section is that companies must harness artificial intelligence (AI). TCS’ Harrick Vin explains two key challenges that AI poses to companies. In our interview with Dartmouth Professor Vijay Govindarajan, he discusses how to accelerate culture changes of the type that digital technology is forcing companies to make.
TCS’ Satya Ramaswamy’s 2016 Harvard Business Review article, reprinted here in Perspectives, explains one big change that nearly every company will have to make over the rest of the decade to get smarter—listening and acting quickly upon the digital data that is streaming in from the wireless sensors they have installed in their products. Whether your company makes cars, coffee machines, or barbecues, it must give special treatment to such Internet of Things data that shows how your products are performing for customers.
We also profile The Associated Press, the 170-year-old news service that has been using AI to produce quarterly earnings stories without dedicating staff to write them. By the end of 2015, the software was generating 3,700 quarterly earnings stories covering all listed U.S. companies (and some in Canada). That has freed up AP’s human workforce to do the deeper enterprise reporting its member newspapers need.
However, getting smarter through AI forces companies to get far better at analyzing the digital data that is coursing through their data centers. In her article, TCS’ Lipika Dey explains the new tools for doing such crucial analytics. Our interview with University of Texas at Austin Professor Prabhudev Konana explores the metrics and skills necessary for analytics to have impact in an organization.
Finally, in this section the head of TCS’ banking & financial services practice, K. Krithivasan, explains how banks and financial services firm are using analytics to make better decisions.
Getting Faster
As Tonya McKinney and Dave Anderson explain in their article on dynamic customer journeys, companies must design their customer journeys to respond to changes faster. They must also change their journeys in an agile, iterative fashion by monitoring every consumer channel, and every touch point, continuously.
TCS’ Sunder Singh and Akhilesh Tiwari discuss in their article how global companies are getting faster at implementing enterprise systems. Ajoy Mukerjee, TCS’ global head and vice president of human resources, explores how big companies can identify the key talent they will need long before others do.
Companies need to turn uncertainty about who the new competitors may be into their advantage, as CEO consultant Ram Charan explains in our interview with him. Our case study on Microsoft’s embrace of machine learning shows how companies can gain share (for instance, the search engine market) by adopting new approaches to enhance digital products.
At the end of this section, the heads of TCS’ retail (Pratik Pal) and life sciences practices (Debashis Ghosh) explain how companies are getting quicker at understanding their performance for customers and integrating acquisitions.
Getting Lighter
To get lighter, companies need to embrace technologies that reduce their IT burden and costs, such as cloud computing, automation, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). At the same time, they should seek expertise of third parties without having to inflate their workforces. This is what Nidhi Srivastava, global head of IT consulting at TCS, examines in her article.
Getting lighter places even greater demands on companies that make multiple acquisitions. They need to quickly integrate the operations of their newly purchased companies—for example, in six months rather than years, as TCS’ vice president of business consulting Dave Jordan lays out in his article. Merging IT-intensive operations is one of the best ways for two companies to shed excess weight—business processes, applications, hardware, and other infrastructure that are no longer necessary when one company is taken over by another.
Companies that can profit from changing environments, and are built to incorporate continuous transformations, will be the ones all of us will be doing business with tomorrow and for the foreseeable future.
In our interview with Professor Jeanne Ross of the MIT Sloan School, she explains how digital companies are able to move at the speed of light and the lessons for established companies that now must become digital.
Big data tool provider Cloudera is using its own technology to identify the changes its customers must make on the systems it runs for them, as its chief strategy officer, Mike Olson, explains in the case study on the company. And the head of TCS’ manufacturing practice, Milind Lakkad, explains how manufacturers can lighten up their operations while remaining world-class.

2,"The software development community has been using the term ‘agile’ for more than 20 years. But over the last decade, agile approaches have jumped the tracks to the rest of the business world.
The reason is clear: The success of large companies now depends on using digital technologies to reinvent their business models; automate and monitor the performance of their products and services using embedded wireless sensors; use technologies to bring intelligence and personalized interactions with customers; and make all this possible by tapping into the huge on-demand computing power of cloud providers.
Each article in this issue of Perspectives dissects today’s urgent need for companies to have industrial-strength capabilities in agile to manage their businesses. We group the articles in three sections.
1. The Essence of Agile
In ‘Embracing Agility Means Agility by the Business, for the Business,’ Nidhi Srivastava of TCS discusses why big companies must embrace agile practices when they build new businesses, design new business processes, and develop the systems that support them. As she explains, a big reason is that ‘digital natives’ (companies born on the Internet like Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb and Amazon) have inherent advantages over older companies. Established companies need to get agile quickly to compete. However, Srivastava also shows why they shouldn’t attempt to make every part of their organization agile all at the same time. Instead, they need to phase in agile approaches carefully.
The next article in this section explains how in the early days of agile software development, the idea was to bring business people and software developers into the same room. Today, that’s a quaint notion. Agile teams in many enterprises stretch across time zones. It’s now unrealistic to expect all agile team members to sit side by side. In their article ‘How to Make Location-Independent Agile Work’, K. Subramanian and Mohammed Musthafa S. explain how to make dispersed agile team members work as one.
It may seem like a 21st century phenomenon, but the mandate for big companies to become more ‘agile’ actually goes back decades. As MIT Sloan School Prof. Michael Cusumano reminds us in our recent interview with him ‘From Making Autos to Making Software: The Evolution of Lean and Agile’, in the 1980s Japanese automobile manufacturers were producing cars faster on the assembly line than their U.S. and European peers, with less labor, and fewer defects—all the while reducing the time it took to develop new models.
Cusumano and his MIT colleagues referred to these manufacturing methods as ‘lean.’ In many ways, it was a precursor to agile.
Software powerhouse Microsoft, which Cusumano studied in the 1990s, applied what are now called ‘agile’ practices to designing and developing software— before the authors of the Agile Manifesto put their label on the practice and posted their document in 2001. In our interview, Cusumano lays out what’s new and old about agile.
2. Applying Agile
Innovation is a fundamental reason why companies adopt agile management practices—that is, the ability to source promising ideas and turn them into new products, services, processes and even new businesses at lightning speed. In their article ‘Enterprise Agility: Pushing Innovation to the Edge of the Organization’, TCS consultants Courtney Wood and Apala Mukherjee show why some of the best agile adopters have empowered their people on the front lines to identify new business opportunities.
If you think that agile is something everyone below you in your organization needs to learn (but not you), then think again. In their article ‘Effective Leadership of Agile Organizations: Building a Culture of Servant Leadership’, Nidhi Srivastava and Carl Shea discuss why leaders of organizations that wish to become agile must absorb the mindsets and master the skills required to make those below them successful.
In the last article in this section, we are honored to have a pioneer of Silicon Valley-style lean and agile approaches. He is Steve Blank, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has been a cog in the wheel of the lean startup movement. Blank more recently has been teaching lean startup approaches to big, longstanding organizations, both in business and government. He tells us about that in our interview with him ‘The Tall Task of Getting Big Companies and Government to Innovate Like Lean Startups’.
3. Agile at Work
Taking the lead from the digital natives they increasingly compete against, two industries have been at the forefront of adopting agile practices: retail and financial services. In their article ‘How Retail CEOs Can Drive Agile to Grow Their Business’, Rajashree R. and Pratik Pal of TCS explain how several large retailers have used agile approaches to bring innovative business models, business processes, and customer offerings to market faster. They show why taking half-measures with agile don’t go far enough in keeping retailers competitive.
Because money essentially is a product that can be fully digital, banks and financial services firms have been under attack for years from digitally savvy startups that have made mortgage and auto loans faster, payments and payment processing easier, and stock trades cheaper. In their article ‘Fending Off the FinTechs: How Agile Financial Services Firms are Transforming Their Businesses’, TCS consultants RamanaMurthy Magapu and Sathish Sankaranarayanan explain how a number of established financial institutions have used agile approaches to strike back successfully. They also explain how to get past the barriers that hold financial services firms from embracing agile practices.
Finally, in our last article ‘Why Your Agile Team is Better Off Dispersed: The Case for Location-Independent Agile’, I explain why large companies around the world now need to significantly scale up their agile approaches to process improvement, product and service development, and business model innovation. I show why scaling up agile requires making it truly location-independent.

3,"Many exciting new digital technologies have evolved rapidly this decade–potent mobile devices that perform a myriad of tasks, big data and analytics tools that crunch petabytes of data, and Internet of Things sensors that report continuously on everything from our cars to our coffee pots. So it may surprise you that a far older technology–artificial intelligence (AI)–is poised to become the primary driver of business transformation by 2020.
How can that be, given that AI has occupied the pages of science fiction for at least 75 years and technology labs for more than 50? While it sounds old-hat compared to emerging technologies, AI is beginning to revolutionize the way companies do business.
That is why we see articles every week about what cognitive systems are achieving or can achieve: driving cars without anyone in them over long stretches, beating the world’s best player at a complex game (the Asian game ‘Go’ is the latest), outperforming surgeons at stitching up a pig, and spitting out financial stories faster than even a big newsroom could.
It is also why new multibillion-dollar businesses for services are flourishing–Uber for taxis, Airbnb for booking rooms, and the personal digital assistants of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others. For sure, they are capitalizing on a bunch of digital technologies. But it is the modern strain of artificial intelligence, or cognitive technologies if you prefer the more modern nomenclature, which now makes them possible.
To put it succinctly, the cognitive wave is here. The question is whether your company is ready to ride it. That is what this article will try to answer. It will give you an overview of the technology and explain the two biggest challenges to using cognitive tools to transform your business in the years ahead.
The Basics: What is Cognitive Technology?
To understand why cognitive technologies will be transformative, you first have to understand what they are and what they can do. Think of cognitive technologies as performing four core tasks:
1. Sense
Until the last few years, computers have been very poor at doing what humans do with ease—scanning the environment around them and understanding the context. The reason is that most computers had neither the capabilities nor the processing power to analyze anything but ‘structured’ data. By structured, I mean the transaction data of a spreadsheet or database with numbers in it. ‘Unstructured’ data is the source food for cognitive systems—the text of a call center’s transcript of a customer conversation, the thousands of online articles published every day, the static images of pictures and moving images of video, and so on. The world is full of digitized data today, and it is doubling every two years, according to IDC. 1Between 2013 and 2020, it is predicted to increase ten-fold. But 80% or more of it is unstructured, which is one reason that only an estimated 22% of digital data in 2013 could be analyzed.2 But this is changing: cognitive technologies can increasingly assimilate and mine unstructured data in a wide range of formats, extract relevant information from them (e.g., existence of a person or an animal in a picture, or extracting sentiments from a blob of text), handle multiple overlapping data sources and versions, and perform data integrity and completeness checks, among other tasks. This kind of capability is opening up a complex new world of possibilities.
2. Think
A cognitive system is not useful if it only recognizes data; it must also decide what that data means, and at the speed of light. Cognitive technologies use machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze the context gleaned during the ‘sense’ phase to understand and characterize normal behavior. This is used to predict future system behavior under expected and anomalous conditions as well as produce actionable insights and recommendations.
3. Act
After the system has arrived at some insights, it needs to drive an automatic reaction that corrects things. If a car manufacturer has trained an onboard system to sense electronic control data from its automobiles and discern when they are heading for mechanical problems, the system must also figure out proactive actions to correct those problems and improve customer experience. A driverless car is AI on four wheels—an automobile that is continually sensing, thinking, and acting in order to avoid all the hazards of busy roads. Cognitive systems think and act like experts. Unlike a robot, they do not need to be programmed with explicit instructions to perform actions in all possible contexts the system may encounter. Instead, cognitive systems mimic the human brain; they combine self-learned context with reusable patterns to construct procedures to perform complex activities utilizing reusable simple skills.
4. Learn
The best cognitive systems do not stop at acting on some data that they have analyzed. Through technologies such as machine learning, they are able to continuously refine their knowledge and algorithmic models based on the real-world outcomes from them. Like people, cognitive systems need to be designed to learn from experience—the systems’ experience. Most cognitive systems support two methods for continuous learning—explicit training and observational self-learning.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW? 
 THE PERFECT STORM
A new class of computer systems can now sense, think, act, and learn. Why is that happening now? And where is it all going?
It is happening now because what we are witnessing today is the perfect digital storm. Products, processes, and information systems today are getting hyper-instrumented and hyper-connected. Wireless sensors in devices ranging from mobile phones and cars, to computer printers are reporting on their performance. Extensive networks are connecting everything. Big data and analytics technologies can crunch the data that is being emitted.
So all the technical elements of the perfect storm—the digital technologies that can guide what people need to do—are in place. Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk (the connected, self-driving electric car), Travis Kalanick (Uber), and Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia (Airbnb) are the ones turning those perfect storm elements into viable new businesses that are giving entrenched industries a run for their money.
Uber does not own taxis or taxi drivers (they are contractors). Yet its latest round of fund raising valued it at more than $60 billion. In 2014, its revenues in its home San Francisco market alone were more than three times what taxis were generating in the city.3 Clearly, consumers are using Uber much more than taxis, for its convenience and other reasons.
Clearly, Uber has seized the perfect storm of digital technologies, and it is reshaping a century-old industry.
Is your industry next? And, if so, is your company prepared?
Preparing for the Storm
To be able to lead this cognitive wave, companies will have to overcome several challenges. They are many and disparate, but you could group them into two broad categories—technical challenges, and people and safety challenges.
Let us start with the technical ones. Oddly enough, ‘technical’ does not mean ‘technology.’ It is really about knowledge and how to codify it so you can train an AI system to do the task you want it to do, whether it is to drive a car, perform a surgery, monitor and protect a household when the family is away (or even at home), and much more.
No matter how much sophisticated technology is in a cognitive system and how well it can sense, think, act, and learn about some issue it will not be useful unless it can also collect and sense the right digital data, think and act on that data, and then perfect its learning for the future. Take the self-driving automobile. Its developers, whether they are at Tesla or Toyota, must understand the physics of a car, the physics of braking, the physics of other objects such as other cars, trucks, deer and people, that share the road with it, the physics of weather and every part of the internal and external physical environment that enables the car to operate without colliding into something. To cite one narrow slice of this, how much braking should be applied in bad conditions such as rain or snow? Does it depend on the weight of the car? (yes). The height of the car? (yes). The speed of the car? (yes). The road conditions? (yes).
And that, in turn, means the developers of the self-driving car need to capture that knowledge coherently. That is not the topic that most people talk about when discussing AI and cognitive technologies. They are largely discussing the technology pieces—the natural language software, the image-recognition technologies, and so on. That is all necessary, but not sufficient.
You need to capture the domain knowledge necessary to train a car to drive as expertly and hopefully better than the most skillful drivers. That is a huge barrier, and it takes a huge amount of effort to overcome it.
The second challenge involves the people and safety issues. The people issues are probably the most perplexing. What new jobs might arise in that firm given that the ‘doers of work’ can be liberated from those manual jobs and become ‘creators and curators of knowledge’? TCS conducted a major study this year of what more than 800 mostly big companies are doing with AI. One big finding was that the companies getting the greatest value from the technology in terms of revenue and cost improvements can envision the technology both automating more jobs and creating additional new jobs, as compared to the companies realizing less value from AI.
What happens to a company that can automate 60% of its workforce through AI systems?
Cognitive systems are about to unleash huge changes in big companies, which I boil down to automating the work of the ‘doers’ and liberating them to take on the new jobs of creation and curation of knowledge. But that, of course, poses big questions for companies—how do they determine which jobs can be automated? How do they determine what the new jobs will be? And then how do they retrain and redeploy people for those new jobs? It figures to be a massive job and skill shift that will keep many chief HR officers awake at night. History, however, does indicate that this problem is solvable.
A 2015 Deloitte study found that during the past 144 years, new technologies have created more jobs than they have destroyed.4
As for the safety issues, how do we make products and processes powered by cognitive systems safe for people and for companies? Consider the self-driving car example again. When you design and develop the autonomous vehicle to avoid an accident, if the choice is between the driver suffering in a crash or another car or pedestrian suffering, which one does the system choose? It is a huge ethical (and probably legal) dilemma.
The other safety issue is one we have heard about for decades: computer security. How do we build cognitive systems that cannot be hacked, or at least easily hacked? In our study, this turned out to be the biggest challenge for the 800+ companies we surveyed, and it is not likely to go away.
Jumping on the Wave
Experienced surfers know how to time the waves just right. The same will hold true with companies and cognitive systems. But it is becoming more evident by the day that most large companies, across most industries, need to climb on top of that board now because the perfect conditions are here. It is time to begin exploring and investing seriously and strategically in harnessing the power of cognitive systems to reimagine your business.

4,"We have all seen some eye-bulging numbers in recent years about the Internet of Things (IoT). Since 2011, General Electric has publicly stated it would spend more than $1 billion on developing sensors, wireless devices, and related software to install on its aircraft engines, power turbines, locomotive trains and other machinery. Companies such as Ford, Toyota, and Caterpillar have invested heavily as well. And our own survey of 795 large companies (average revenue of $22 billion) in North America, Europe, Asia-Paciﬁc, and Latin America found average per-company spending on IoT initiatives—$86 million in 2015—was projected to grow to $103 million by 2018.
Yet it would be a mistake to think that IoT is a game only for high rollers and crack technologists. Our research and client engagement experience has shown us that generating strong returns from the digital sensors, wireless communications devices, digital cameras installed in buildings and other smart, connected devices does not come down to writing big checks or being technologically savvy. The companies with the greatest value from IoT to date are the best at dealing with how products are performing for customers.
Once you accept that, it becomes a lot easier to understand what you need to do to get value from IoT.
Of course, every company eventually gets the truth about how its products and services are performing for customers. The call center logs customer complaints. Spot surveys become snapshots of limited customer input. More recently, social media monitoring tools have given companies the means of seeing who is sounding oﬀ on their oﬀerings around the clock and around the world. But for many companies, such truth often comes too late—after customers have decided to ﬁnd another supplier.
Consider a recent example: A friend’s coﬀeemaker that he purchased two years ago just went on the blink. It was an expensive machine, but it is past the warranty period. His wife called the manufacturer, who walked her through a troubleshooting routine, but to no avail. The rep then said the company would mail the customer a diagnostic tool in 7-10 days so the customer could troubleshoot it further.
Like the two-thirds of American adults who consume at least one cup of coﬀee a day (according to Gallup), he and his wife are miﬀed. They need a coﬀee maker right away, and will not wait at least a week to get a possible ﬁx for the machine they have. They told me they will now buy a competing brand.
The manufacturer could have avoided losing its customer had it installed a wireless digital sensor that reported on how well the machine was performing. If it had, the ﬁrm might have been able to alert the customer that the machine was headed for downtime before it happened, and sent the diagnostic tool before it broke down. Now the company will lose out on the big revenue stream from this customer that follows the machine: the money from its coﬀee pods.
This kind of data, on how a company’s product is performing in the ﬁeld for customers, is, indeed, the ultimate truth because it can alert companies to product problems and customers who are about to defect. This truth could be very diﬀerent from what the company thought it was or was marketing it as. It is the ultimate truth because most companies get this information far too late, when a loyal customer has left them behind without a “Dear John” note.
In our survey, we found that as of last year, only 26% of big companies had put IoT technologies into their products. In other words, three out of four did not have the means to get the ultimate truth on product performance. What is more, that percentage generally goes down, the lower the price of a product. For example, only 6% of companies selling products with less than $100 price tags had embedded wireless sensors in their oﬀerings. In contrast, 54% of companies whose products’ average sales price was between $1 million and $10 million did have digital sensors that communicated product performance back to them.
But even if your ﬁrm has installed IoT technologies in its products, that does not mean it is about to get the ultimate truth about those products or that it will do something with that information. That requires your ﬁrm to do much more.
We see four key elements of using the IoT to get the ultimate truth on product performance:
1. Getting customers to agree to have their products monitored, which in turn means giving them something of value in return.
To get value from the IoT, you have to give value ﬁrst. Or as Intel Corp.’s vice president and GM of its $2 billion IoT business Jonathan Ballon says: “The beneﬁt has to be to customers. There has to be a value exchange,” he told us. This is especially the case when a company’s wireless sensors are transmitting sensitive customer data such as medical conditions. HP Inc., the part of the old Hewlett-Packard that makes printers, printing ink, PCs, and other digital devices, has found the same thing in its HP Instant Ink initiative. HP outﬁtted its printers in 2013 with wireless sensors that monitor ink levels and automatically trigger reorders before customers run out. So HP dangled cost savings of up to 50% and solved a problem (i.e., running out of ink), and it enticed many customers. The CIO of HP Inc., Naresh Shanker, told us: “There has to be customer value—cost savings, very high-quality ink, a great customer experience—all of that.”
2.  Product performance data must be processed and acted upon quickly.
Had my friend’s coﬀee maker been equipped with a digital sensor, the manufacturer may have had the chance to keep him a loyal customer. But that would have required it to be able to quickly process huge volumes of digital data (think about companies with millions of customers and millions of products in the ﬁeld). And that would have then required the company to trigger an automated response, e.g., a customer call center to reach out to the customer; an email to be sent out saying (for example) that they will try to diagnose and ﬁx the problem remotely; and then (if the ﬁx is deduced) an enterprise resource planning system that is triggered to order a part to arrive at the customer (if the customer can ﬁx it himself) and issue a bill for that part. In other words, a company’s IoT systems must be connected to its ERP systems for billing, distribution, repair and other activities to “make the product right.” So now the “product” is not just the physical object that was sold to the customer but also the entire set of systems and experiences that stand behind it.
3.  A culture that accepts the truth, however bad.
Of all the technologies that companies have implemented in the last 50 years, the IoT may face the greatest organizational resistance. What product line leaders, production heads, or R&D executives will want the CEO to know on a daily basis that the products that they developed and delivered are having trouble in the ﬁeld with customers? Said Intel’s Ballon, “Without question, the biggest barrier to the internet of things by a large margin is cultural. It’s organizational inertia that gets in the way. People are afraid what new technologies might reveal about the business.” From our survey, we found one of the many ways companies that had gained the biggest beneﬁts to date from the IoT diﬀered from the rest is the support for IoT at the top of the company. “The companies I ﬁnd that are brave are driving this change from the top,” said Ballon. “The more timid and change-averse companies tend to dig in with their feet, get lost in the weeds, and take too long to make technology decisions.”
4.  “Reimagining the business” must become the mantra.
Digital technologies like the Internet of Things allow companies to do things operationally that were impossible or infeasible before. Technology for monitoring product performance has been used for decades but largely on very expensive and critical products such as public elevators. (You do not want people to be trapped in an elevator very long, and companies like Otis Elevator have outﬁtted their products for years with technologies that report on such outages). The Internet of Things gives companies the opportunity to monitor product performance of the cheapest of products. For example, Procter & Gamble has had an electronic toothbrush with wireless sensors for two years. In our research, we found companies such as grocery giant Kroger reducing checkout lines through technology that monitors its stores. Auto insurers have been oﬀering usage-based policies based on technologies that track the way customers actually drive simply by leveraging their customers’ existing smartphones. The opportunities to reimagine how to do business are abundant. But they only happen to companies that are open to reimagining the way they have done business for years.
When companies are prepared to deal with these four, they will be far more likely to see and act eﬀectively on the possibilities of the Internet of Things. By dealing with the ultimate truth well—how their products are performing every day for customers—they will be far more likely to keep their customers for the long haul.

5,"You probably need little evidence to believe that the experience your company provides to its customers—in learning about, buying, and using your offerings—is hugely important today. But for the few doubting Thomases left in the business world, I have data (Google data, that is).
As you might know, Google tracks the world’s digital information. According to its indexing of books since the 1980s, seen in Figure 1 using the Google Ngram Viewer1, the term ‘customer experience’ trawls along the bottom of the chart until 1997, a time in which (and not so coincidentally) customer relationship management systems began sprouting up in large corporations. (One of the pioneers and early powerhouses of CRM software, Siebel Systems, was born just four years before that.) Then the curve shoots up, all the way through 2008 (the last year for which Google’s Ngram Viewer provides results).

Figure 1: The Rise in Interest in Customer Experience (as Shown in Books Indexed by Google)2
So what about since 2008? We turn to another Google product, Google Trends. It indexes how many times the term was used in Google searches. The answer: The popularity of the term has more than doubled since 2008, as shown in Figure 2 below.

Figure 2: The Rise in Interest in Customer Experience (as Shown in Trends Indexed by Google)3
The notion of the ‘customer experience’ is mesmerizing many C-suites, and it’s not a fad that will fade away. We believe it’s not only here to stay, but that it will become paramount. In fact, many large companies in recent years have come to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ epiphany: becoming obsessed with customers.
The time to transform the experience your company provides customers is now. Not in two years. Not by 2025. But now. In this issue of TCS Perspectives, we show you how.
The following articles lay out the thinking of top TCS customer experience experts—consultants who work on the front lines with clients, whether they make industrial goods, consumer products or automobiles, or whether they provide services such as walking through retail stores and bank branches, or seats on an airplane or rooms in a hotel. Allow me to tell you a little bit about each article and what I believe makes it noteworthy:
Designing Customer Experiences (CX)
Forget Everything You Know About Bricks and Clicks (It’s Wrong, or Soon Will Be): Authors David Nelson and Jim Walb make a compelling case about why every company must look outside their industry to vault ahead in the customer experience. The key is to look at firms that provide superior outcomes for customers, because ultimately that’s all that matters.
The Four Core Competencies of CX: Interview with Bruce Temkin: The Temkin Group has become renowned for its stellar research on CX leaders in many industries and its practical advice. Bruce lays out four core competencies that he believes are necessary for companies to provide a superior customer experience: purposeful leadership, compelling brand values, customer connectedness, and employee engagement.
When CX Should Begin with Tweaks, Not Disruption: Not every company must come to market with a ‘disruptive’ customer experience. Some only need small adjustments to generate greater customer loyalty, revenue and profit. Paul Ignasinski explores two steps by which companies can identify those opportunities, and put their resources against them.
The Seven Deadly Myths of Today’s B2B Sell: In business-to-business customer interactions, the experience that sales people provide, make or break relationships every day. Lisa Hager sheds light on seven myths that many B2B sales executives and their teams operate under—beliefs about selling that were once sacrosanct but no longer are. She also explains what to do about them.
Personalization Boundaries: Tuning in to Customers Without Turning Them Off: Every company today can, and must, tailor its interactions (especially the digital ones) with customers. In fact, research says customers expect it—until the personal touch turns them off. Dave Anderson and Keith Wheeler explain how to keep within seven guardrails, and prevent personalization from becoming creepy.
Designing for the Small Silver Screen: The iPhone was introduced 10 years ago, and mobile apps now consume hours each day in the average consumer’s life. It’s critical for companies to design their apps right, which isn’t easy because the competition is intense and app technology grows ever more powerful. Two of our app experts, Oghie Ojior and Skip Vanderburg, give you three ways to raise your app game.
Not every company must come to market with a ‘disruptive’ customer experience. Some only need small adjustments to generate greater customer loyalty, revenue and profit.
The CX After the Sale
How IoT Technologies Are Revamping the Post-Sale Experience: The Internet of things seems to be as popular a topic as customer experience. There’s good reason for that: Companies that embed digital sensors in their products and on the premises in which they do business can track customers and how they are using those products. Authors Gill Hide, Alex Prigojine, and Robert Perry explain five fundamental ways that companies can use IoT technologies to dramatically improve what customers do with your offerings after they buy or rent them.
Reimagining the Contact Center with Digital Technologies: The call center is a thing of the past. Companies now need contact centers whose employees (and increasingly AI-driven systems) respond to customers who phone in, email, type in social media comments, and text message their questions and complaints. Natarajan Baskaran and Rohit Kale explain how to evolve the call center in three stages.
The Magic That Can Happen When Manufacturers Digitally Attach Themselves to Their Products: The internet of things is not only turning consumer sectors inside out, it’s now redefining the way industrial and other manufacturers relate to their customers. As Sreenivasa Chakravarti and Subhash Sakorikar explain, companies that take six bold steps, can do wonders in improving the experience that customers have in using their products.
Using IoT Technologies to Completely Rethink the Customer Experience: Interview with Ric Merrifield: Merrifield has been at the intersection of digital technology and business and operational strategy for many years, at Microsoft and other companies. He wrote a groundbreaking Harvard Business Review article on web service architectures nearly 10 years ago, a book called Rethink, and more recent HBR articles on CX in a world of IoT technologies. Merrifield discusses life on the front lines of major CX initiatives at such companies as Starbucks and Disney.
The Future of CX
Why Your CX Must Soon Plug and Play into a Digital Ecosystem: Digital ecosystems are online platforms that make life infinitely easier for consumers by bringing to bear in one place everything they need to make a major purchase—a car, a home, a vacation, and even a new career. Antony Grigg makes a strong case about why executives must figure out how their companies must play in the digital ecosystems that will soon encompass their products and services.
What Comes after CXM? Helping Customers Help Other Customers: CXM is what came after CRM. But
what comes after CXM, when you and your rivals provide competitive customer experiences? Steve Goren and Anthony Butler believe it will be ICRM—Inter-Customer Relationship Management. Simply put, it’s about how a large company can broker business between customers—i.e., customer to customer—in a scalable and profitable way.
The internet of things is not only turning consumer sectors inside out, it’s now redefining the way industrial and other manufacturers relate to their customers.
CX Leadership
How the CEO Can Propel a CX Initiative: CX is indeed a CEO issue, and there are five crucial roles for CEOs to play in these initiatives. In my concluding article, I examine how the leaders of Domino’s Pizza, Burberry, Pepsi, Virgin Group, and Airbnb played these roles, and by doing so ensured the success of the initiatives.
Just as your company strives to delight customers in their journey of buying, using, and renewing the purchase of your products, we strive too in this edition of TCS Perspectives to intrigue you with our ideas. We strongly welcome your feedback.

6,"Today’s companies do not struggle to collect a lot of data: They struggle to wring value from that data. Thanks to big data tools becoming mainstream during the last few years, many companies have gathered huge data sets. Few have grabbed the real prize—using that data to make smarter business decisions in new product development, customer service, marketing, sales, and other key business functions. What is holding them back?
Companies across all industry vertical segments, from telecom to manufacturing, see the potential of analytics and seek to gain competitive advantage from it. And they are spending heavily to do so: revenues for sellers of big data and business analytics will rise from $122 billion in 2015 to $187 billion in 2019 globally, according to research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).1
Despite all that spending, several challenges prevent many companies from realizing strong ROI on analytics projects. For starters, companies struggle to find the right metrics for analytics projects. Next, given the amount of data that can be collected—think petabytes in a day—companies often wrestle with carving out subsets for targeted analysis. Notably, companies may ignore or fail to fully tap into rich new data sources, such as social data and mobile app data.
In another significant obstacle, companies face an increasing amount of unstructured data to analyze (such as text, images, and voice calls). This is not ignorable data: some useful business insights (say on customer satisfaction issues) will only come up in unstructured data. Companies can analyze this unstructured data to improve customer satisfaction and brand image association, for example.
But analyzing unstructured data adds a layer of complexity to analytics projects. For example, how do you coordinate this information with structured business data from traditional enterprise software? Additionally, unstructured data comes in from multiple channels (phone calls, email, social media posts, surveys) and each channel has pros and cons. For instance, if you are analyzing social media posts, you may not know what percentage of your customers are using social media. Internal contact center data offers better statistical estimates. Additionally, fake customer reviews are a well-known phenomenon in social media and elsewhere online; companies must address such reviews, but these reviews do not offer value for analytics projects. A judicious approach is to listen to social media posts for signals pointing to particular issues, then collect more data around each issue in a systematic fashion through targeted questions or surveys for valuable analysis. Unstructured data mining can also raise privacy concerns, especially health and insurance data.
Finally, too much analytical data remains in too many business silos. How do you identify and share the data most wanted by front-line managers to enable better decision-making? This is where speed comes in: You cannot be smart if you cannot get insight to the front line fast. One key is mapping analytics work to the right business owners and processes. Pursuing holistic analytics work across departments and functions, rather than doing siloed analytics work, is key to producing strong ROI for the business.
Shortcomings of Current Analytics Approaches and Tools
Today’s analytics tools and techniques can fall short in several respects for companies seeking to turn data into valuable business insights to wield against rivals. Often, judging the ROI of analytics projects proves tough, because some companies track too many metrics, or the wrong metrics. For example, social media analysis often gets stuck with key performance indicators (KPIs) like positive and negative sentiment indices, or number of likes or shares. But the number of likes or shares, on its own, does not indicate how many people have actually read or heard the content.
Traditional industry data streams (for example, from finance and sales software) do not reveal enough. They are tapped out. What is more, every one of your competitors use the same data in the same way, which does not offer much hope for competitive differentiation. This leads smart companies to think creatively about additional data sources. For example, online real estate company Trulia analyzes more than a terabyte of data daily, in its work to give personalized suggestions to potential home buyers. Its multiple data streams include new home listings, public records, and user behavior data.2 When a new listing matches a customer’s preferences, the customer gets an alert.
Traditional BI systems share data through reports. However, well-built analytics dashboards enable business-side managers to ask more and smarter questions, leading to smarter decisions. For example, Walmart analyzes social streams3 (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest) to feed data into social media analytics dashboards for its product buyers, who can capitalize on customer interest in products such as juice machines or a particular shade of nail polish.
Deploying such dashboards is not easy. Analytics teams may think that if they just get the right BI tool to the business, they have cracked the problem. But business users seek prescriptive advice, not just attractive visualizations, for the tool to gain widespread use and effectiveness.
While more companies now collect unstructured data, many still keep too much of it in departmental or other organizational silos.
While more companies now collect unstructured data, many still keep too much of it in departmental or other organizational silos. For instance, social media data may be collected and analyzed in one business silo, and so will support center and call center data. Today’s BI tools do not help much with visualization of unstructured data, or linking structured data to unstructured data. What is more, models of how to deal with unstructured data are not mature yet, so companies fail to find best practice models.
As a result of all these factors, companies focus too much on handling the volume of data, and not enough on cutting across business silos to find the right information at the right time—the magic moment when business value appears.
A Smarter Analytics Approach
Successful analytics projects seek to flip that focus, and cut across the boundaries that keep valuable information trapped. Let us delve into some techniques companies are using to overcome the challenges and derive more value from analytics work, starting with finding the right metrics.
This starts with rethinking KPIs for analytics projects. If you want different departments to work together, you must look for a holistic or cross-department measure. For example, on customer service analysis projects, do not use call resolution, but single-contact resolution across all channels, such as email, phone, and social media. This ensures that social customer service teams drive towards the ‘one and done’ ideology so customers are not just hopping to another channel for answers.
Rather than creating and tracking a separate set of KPIs for unstructured data, seek to link the analytical insights to business processes, and thus standard business KPIs. This helps prove business value and ROI.
To do this, companies can use software tools to model the relevant business knowledge, organized by business divisions, products or attributes of products, capture the business rules, and match up the data. For example, a company may use tools such as Clarabridge, Clearforest, and Temis to analyze large chunks of text and route key insights to appropriate business units. Companies also use custom-built tools for the purpose, though such cases are rare.
In one project of this kind, a leading U.S. retail chain needed to analyze customer survey text. It used a suite of tools to do information extraction, text labeling, business modeling, and sentiment analysis. The tools automate work that would otherwise have to be done by hand, for instance, categorizing similar groups of products and customers. The retail chain gained insights on different product categories. Issues for each product category were further classified by factors such as price, product quality, associate behavior, store cleanliness, product availability, and variety. Combined with the geographical information about the stores, the retailer identified actionable insights to increase sales.
A grocery store could use a similar approach to analyze huge sets for customer sentiment data. For example, text analysis can group customer complaints from multiple channels (phone, email, social, survey) under labels. Comments such as “lower your prices,” “checkout lines are too long,” or “I love your dairy products, but keep more types of cheese” can be grouped and acted upon. The business labels might be pricing, checkout process, dairy, and variety. Without automated analysis tools and good mapping back to business process, you could try to analyze such data. However, it would take many people, and there would be subjectivity bias in interpreting the comments. Here, if there is a bias, it is uniform across the data. Also, with automation, the company can run reports like this every 24 hours.
Mapping analytics insights to divisions, products, and services leads to valuable input from business-side teams on what business KPIs, such as a customer satisfaction index and sales volume, relate to the project. For example, if you are doing customer sentiment analysis on social data for an online retailer, the ultimate business KPI is sales. Effective metrics could include click-to-conversion rates or lead generation to sales conversion rates.
New Data Sets, New Tools
In addition to rethinking metrics, it is also important to take a fresh look at your data sources, since valuable information lies in mobile app, geographic, and Internet of Things data, for example. What is more, an emerging and intriguing source to consider is news feed data.
News data can inform everyday business activities, especially at the strategic level, and help a company build contextual intelligence, which is highly desirable. For example, if you are acquiring a business in a new geography, you want to build intelligence about economic factors, political issues, and lessons learned by other companies in that locale.4 Multinationals setting up in India or China face many local issues that have to be understood. In another example, an auto company would want to be up-to-date on all news related to changes in pollution-related laws in regions for which it is designing vehicles. The earlier companies come to know of such changes, the better.
Human analysts can only look at so much news. But today, companies such as Bloomberg and RavenPack offer tools that scan and organize large volumes of news content and social media posts for purposes like these, as well as for financial services and stock trading.
In addition to new data sources, companies want to examine additional data analysis methods and tools (to complement traditional ones). For unstructured text analysis, open graph databases and NoSQL databases prove helpful (in addition to natural language processing tools). Why? In a NoSQL database, data is stored as key-value pairs and not in tables with predefined schema. This helps in indexing unstructured data and retrieving it quickly. Open graph databases are all about resources linking to resources, as in Wikipedia’s example. Wikipedia holds a great deal of unstructured data, but a graph on top links resources. This helps resolve certain issues related to handling unstructured text. For example, using Wikipedia, software tools can easily conclude that the entities ‘Barack Obama’ and ‘President of the U.S.’ refer to the same person.
For example, using Wikipedia, software tools can easily conclude that the entities ‘Barack Obama’ and ‘President of the U.S.’ refer to the same person.
Today, many linked open data sources store valuable information curated from the unstructured content of Wikipedia, ready for business use. Companies can use them to obtain valuable information like “Honda is a competitor of Toyota” or “Toyota manufactures Camry” without much effort. A company might deploy tools that use this knowledge to continuously track negative sentiments about its competitors or their products, or positive sentiments about its own brand.
Unstructured Data, Surprise Insights
What kind of results can companies glean from analytics projects that include a fresh approach to KPIs, multiple data sets, and unstructured data? Often, unstructured data yields insights you may not envision at the start of the project.
Consider the case of an insurance company with global presence in more than 70 countries, which operated a toll-free call center to receive customer complaints. After the company observed, over two months, that call durations grew significantly longer than expected, it decided to examine the calls using analytics tools.
Speech-to-text technology helped transcribe the audio calls. In addition to examining the transcript, analysis included non-linguistic parameters like lengths of silence, number of call transfers within one call, and so on. Clustering techniques grouped like communications together, and communications were mapped to services provided by the insurance company.
Analyzing customer complaint content may not only reveal frequent customer problems, but also identify business process flaws.
The insurance company discovered several unexpected insights. Not only did the technology identify the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, deeper analysis revealed flaws in its process for handling new insurance policy requests. The company gained actionable insights for improving that process. Addressable flaws in the call-center operational processes also came to light, adding more ROI on the analytics work.
Conquering Common Barriers
With analytics projects like these, the smartest companies seek to make the data-driven insights available across the company, not just in isolated departments. That is how companies move beyond incremental analytics project success to company-wide business improvements, as has been exemplified by companies such as Procter & Gamble and GE. Potentially valuable insights will perish if stuck inside silos. For example, as cited above, analyzing customer complaint content may not only reveal frequent customer problems, but also identify business process flaws. Often, owners of analytics projects are only concerned about a specific issue—say brand reputation—and do not bother with other insights that come out of the data.
To change this mindset, and to combat cultural resistance to sharing data across organizational boundaries, you need executive support from C-suite leaders. Executives can also pave the way for moving to new KPIs tied closely to business results. Any change to KPIs can create pushback, since it affects compensation for people from management to delivery teams. So people need to understand the business benefit, as articulated by the CEO. A clear business objective will not only put new KPIs in context for the team, but also ease the case for proving ROI in business terms.
Privacy and compliance issues pose a final hurdle that can trip up analytics projects, especially those involving unstructured data. For example, if a customer intended a communication (call, e-mail) to serve one purpose, the company may not be able to harvest additional insight without suitable permissions in place. In banking, a customer communication may reveal the need for a product or service. However, banks face many regulations in using that information. Insurance companies and internal HR departments see similar restrictions around health information. Your company’s internal privacy and compliance experts should be looped in early in the analytics project to stave off wasted efforts or possible privacy violations.
Answering the Analytics Challenge
The time has come to pay attention to unstructured data, such as customer communication data that is being ignored. In the cases of the retail chain and insurance company, these brands surfaced actionable business information from their data before rivals were able to capitalize on weak spots, and realized ROI directly tied to business goals.
Try to look beyond optimizing business operations by analyzing sales and revenue graphs. Smart analytics platforms can link structured and unstructured data about your company and its rivals, to generate new insights about the ‘why’ of business intelligence. Beyond the sales or revenue graphs, unstructured data holds valuable clues to what excites or dismays your customers—issues that may not have been on the radar at all. Combine this with public information about your competitors, and the data mined from sources such as news feeds and social media, and you get a fuller picture of your competitive situation, faster than before.
Companies have become experts at analyzing sales spikes and falls, adding in seasonal variation. The smart ones have also learned to capitalize on unstructured data. For example, clothing retailers in the U.K. jumped on the opportunity to sell blue dresses that looked similar to the one Princess Kate wore in a photo celebrating her engagement, and later, baby clothing modeled after her childrens’ outfits.
What will the next opportunity look like for apparel retailers, or for any company that masters analytics technology? The answer is out there, ready to be analyzed in unstructured data.

7,"Anyone who has followed the travails of the U.S. newspaper industry knows it has been in a steep decline since the rise of the Web in the 1990s. Between 2003 and 2014, the industry’s annual advertising revenue plunged 56%, from $46 billion to $20 billion. Numerous newspapers have folded (there were 125 fewer U.S. dailies in 2014 than in 2003), and several prominent newspaper chains have gone in and out of bankruptcy over the last two decades.
Nonetheless, for Jim Kennedy, the future of journalism could not be brighter, or more exciting, because he sees technology transforming it. “I think the next 20 to 25 years will be amazing,” says Kennedy, senior vice president of strategy and enterprise development for The Associated Press, the 170-year-old news service. “We will see the rebirth of the journalist.”
The AP is one of the largest newsgathering operations in the world. It is operated as a not-for-profit cooperative, owned by the daily newspapers of the United States and serving 15,000 news outlets worldwide. It reported $568 million in revenue last year.
Kennedy has had an excellent perch from which to observe the recent evolution of the newspaper business. He has been a fixture at AP since 1987, except for an 18-month stint at the turn of the century, as head of planning and product development at The Wall Street Journal’s online edition. In 1995, Kennedy witnessed the birth of Craigslist, one of many websites whose free want-ads siphoned off classified ad revenue from newspapers to the tune of $5 billion alone between 2000 and 2007, according to one estimate.1 A year later, he started the AP’s first department devoted to launching digital products. AP realized back then that it needed to deal with online competitors, and also to start figuring out how to leverage technology to work for, not against, newspapers.
AP’s latest digital initiative is one that harnesses artificial intelligence to write stories.
AP’s latest digital initiative is one that harnesses artificial intelligence to write stories. In 2013, several AP journalists alerted Kennedy to a North Carolina company, Automated Insights, whose AI technology was being used to write releases for the Cleveland Indians baseball team and sports stories for Yahoo. Kennedy and others at AP were intrigued. They put the software to a small test: writing short articles on the weekly statistical performances of National Football League offensive players—stories AP’s newspaper customers could use to supplement their own NFL coverage.
The technology worked. “I thought to myself, ‘That is the acid test,’” Kennedy remembers. “The point was to take a data stream and see if it could be turned it into a narrative blurb [of text] that looked like a human wrote it.” For Kennedy, the experiment validated three important proofs of concept: 1) the software could produce new content that AP’s writers didn’t have time for, yet member newspapers coveted, 2) the content was indistinguishable from stories written by humans, and 3) it could be done rapidly.
The following year, in 2014, the experiment gave AP the confidence to turn the technology loose on another kind of article. AP and Automated Insights trained the AI program to write quarterly earnings stories on publicly held companies. There are 5,300 companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges, far too many for AP’s 65 business journalists to write stories about when the firms announce their quarterly results. In fact, AP’s business reporters wrote about 300 such stories every three months, typically only about the biggest companies (Apple, McDonald’s, and so on) that newspaper readers were interested in. By the end of 2015, after working to train the software to write these 150-word articles using financial data from Zacks Investment Research, the AI was spitting out 3,700 earnings stories every quarter—more than 12 times as many as was possible before.
Importantly, Kennedy notes, AI was not being used to take work away from journalists. It supplemented their work, while giving AP’s daily newspaper owners more of what they wanted: earnings stories covering the smaller companies in their locales, companies with which their local readers had an intimate connection. Training the technology to write short articles about the results of sports games is next, says Kennedy.
To Kennedy, this is merely the beginning of how AI will help AP’s journalists dramatically improve the way they gather, analyze, and produce news. He sees AI giving the AP three big opportunities for the rest of the decade and beyond: continuing to produce content that its reporters do not have the time to write; giving journalists tools to see patterns and make connections from the mountains of data that have been collected about people, organizations, and issues; and enabling new readers to get answers to specific questions about an organization (company, sports team, government agency, and so on), people, and issues based on AP’s ability to tag items in each article at more granular levels.
Tagging will allow AP to “make our news reports more granular so that we can move it into all kinds of applications that would support vertical industry insights, research use cases, and the on-demand consumer world,” Kennedy explains. “We have an opportunity to expand to other customer segments.”
With that in mind, Kennedy believes the newspaper industry’s embrace of AI has just begun. “I predict that eventually the technology will produce more game stories in sports than humans will,” he says. That, in turn, will not only result in more stories being produced, but it will free up journalists to get the story behind the story, focusing on the more complex articles that readers crave but take more time to produce.
“We have to free our people to produce the kinds of content that no one else has,” concludes Kennedy.

8,"1. Why is a strong analytics effort key to competitive advantage for banking and financial services companies?
As banking and financial services companies search for new revenue streams, analytics projects let them deliver more personalized products in a shorter time to market. Analytics help banks present the customer with the right product at the right time via the right channels. Also, thanks to the growing body of application programming interfaces (APIs) with the ability to connect disparate data sets, banks can create added services for existing customers, often using financial tech companies as sales channel partners.
Machine learning, combined with analytics, teaches banks much about customer behavior and preferences, so the banks can continuously learn and fine tune analytical models to optimize products and services, plus optimize the cost of offering products in various channels. Cloud-based analytics platforms give banks flexibility and elasticity to work with big data workloads at high velocity and reap business value faster.
2. What types of new data sources are banking and financial services companies using to wring more value from data analysis projects?
Given the valuable data now residing in sources ranging from social media posts to mobile applications, banks need to acquire more data types, from more channels. For example, banks work with a growing amount of NoSQL data to harness value from semi-structured data, from sources such as website clickstream tracking reports, weather and news data, product reviews, and social media posts. Hadoop tools can help banks glean insights from unstructured data such as call center customer inquiries, video clips, image scans, and text messages. To deal with these data types efficiently, the unified data architecture approach has become popular. This lets the bank create a unified semantic layer for internal and external data, using APIs to deliver the data to various business groups based on need.
3. What are the biggest worries for BFS companies around analytics right now?
First, data management is a key concern for BFS organizations. As banks use big data tools to analyze data in increasing variety, velocity and volume, governance and data quality become key challenges.
Second, banks must meet significant legal, risk and compliance requirements on the security, auditing, retention, and backup of analytic data. Customer data privacy and security, as well as granular security for employees, also pose key worries as companies explore wider use of analytics.
Finally, BFS companies are struggling to find talented people who can transform analytics data into actionable business data.
4. What is holding back better analytics ROI for these companies?
Several factors hold BFS companies back from realizing more ROI on analytics projects. At some companies, federated business structures and a lack of accountability cause delays in reaping ROI. A unified framework that includes various business processes and points teams toward the same business goals is essential. Additionally, BFS companies struggle with deciding which key performance indicators (KPIs) are critical for managing analytics projects and evaluating analytics project ROI. Until ROI measurement matures, banks will struggle to demonstrate business impact.
Within BFS companies, a great deal of data remains cordoned off. It still does not flow through analytics tools or influence business decisions. Also, some banks remain far away from using big data analytics, machine learning, or real-time analytics because their infrastructure concerns or governance, data privacy, and security worries hinder progress. These banks struggle exploring how to monetize analytics.
Finally, self-service analytics tools have not become a reality for most business users yet. The democratization of data, where people at all levels of a BFS company can access huge amounts of data and derive insights, has not arrived because self-service tools are still emerging. Until those tools mature further, APIs can help banks connect analytics data to day-to-day business processes and automate decision making.

9,"What is the shelf life of the journeys you have mapped out for your customers? How long will they be relevant to their wants and needs?
Is it two years? One year? Six months?
It is a lot shorter than you think.
The customer journey maps that companies use to attract, win, and keep customers degrade quickly because customer preference and purchase criteria change rapidly.
How fast do customer expectations change? In a TCS analytics study on wireless communication providers, we discovered that in early 2013, customer choice was driven by contract.1 By March 2013, T-Mobile—touted as the ‘uncarrier’—had obliterated contracts, which shortly thereafter ceased to be a prime purchase criterion.
Any customer journey designed around the contract experience expired in that quarter, and customers continued changing their wireless provider purchase criteria.
In this research covering millions of social media posts and two years of customer behavior, we observed that the criteria customers used to choose among wireless providers changed fast—some rising (pricing, data, devices such as iPhones), others dropping (contracts, coverage, generic phones). They changed on a monthly basis.
Clearly, if a company creates static or rigid customer journeys, their sell-by dates will come and go just as fast.
We found that customer criteria are not just variable by time; they differ by geography. While wireless phone service customers in Atlanta focused on coverage and download speeds, customers in Oklahoma City were up in arms about what they perceived as ‘data capping’—setting monthly limits on how much digital data they could use at a preferable rate. At the same time, customers in Miami and Houston were more likely to choose providers based on international access and coverage.
Companies of all types—not just wireless carriers—need to pay heed here. To respond to the rapid pace of customer change, companies need to measure the customer experience frequently, if not continuously, across all channels. They also must be operationally adept enough to change as fast as the customer does.
Adjusting at the Speed of Market Shifts
During the 2014 holiday season in the previously mentioned study (Figure 1), the highest number of Twitter discussions in the Southeast U.S. (33%) were on down payments for phones. The next most frequent topics were monthly fees (22%), upgrade fees (17%), and fee waivers (14%). Responding quickly, one provider eliminated down payments on some iPhone models for the holidays. Another provider, noting that upgrade discussions were spiking in Texas, Georgia, and Alabama over the holiday season, offered new phone purchases with lower monthly payments in those regions. It also eliminated upgrade fees for certain programs, and began offering shorter contract terms.
Figure 1: Customer Experience Changes Over a Three-month Period
Over the fall of 2014, the holiday season, the criteria customers used to choose among wireless service providers shifted on a monthly basis.
To stay competitive, all companies must build the internal capability to alter those customer journeys—not in a year, or in a matter of weeks, but potentially in days and hours. Researching customer needs, creating solutions to address them, managing all the possible customer touchpoints, optimizing them for each customer segment, and finally creating a customer experience that encourages the target customer to buy (and remain loyal) must become a continuous activity for companies, not a one-off.
Unfortunately, most companies make a single Herculean effort to map a set of customer journeys. Their designs are often informed by gut instinct and internal anecdotes (which can skew those journeys to whatever hot issues may be affecting one department or another)—not by data. Then these firms spend months and years building out the capabilities for those journeys. However, they do not design them with the capacity for rapid change. Nor do they frequently monitor customer preferences and experience to understand what to change, where to change it, and when.
Customer journey maps need to be dynamic; processes, systems, and even people must have plasticity.
The Four Drivers of Fast-Changing Customer Expectations
Customer preferences change more quickly than businesses expect, largely because of four factors:

Information. Customers inarguably are better informed today. Free and open market information that allows customers to compare prices at every stage of the journey is one of the most disruptive capabilities to come with the mobile internet. Social media and consumer forums are becoming more important in all phases of the customer journey: researching, consideration, purchasing, and servicing.



Social influence. The primary influence on the customer purchasing decision no longer comes from the companies they buy from. It does not come from advertising. It comes from personal recommendations and peer reviews (81%).2 Word-of-mouth recommendations have been industrialized through social media. They are not one-to-one; they are many-to-many, with their impact magnified exponentially. Indeed, 74% of shoppers rely on social networks to make purchase decisions.3 According to a 2012 study by the Chief Marketing Officer Council and Lithium, the purchases of about four out of five U.S. social media users are influenced by their friends’ posts.4

Technology innovation. The pace of technology change has become faster, and customers are adopting new software, hardware, and functionality all the time. This changes their expectations of your technology. Years ago, banks were slow to unveil new ATM features, but today new mobile phones and features are constantly entering the market. The result for banks: many customers expect them to leverage those new features and functions—even in their ATMs.

Market influence. Customers’ interactions with other industries are influencing their expectations of how your business should operate. Previously, you monitored your competition to stay competitive. What happened in another industry—retail, for instance—had little or no impact on insurance, or banking. But every business is now operating on the same or similar online platforms. Almost every company has a website, a mobile app, a Facebook page, a chat interface, etc. So if one industry or company eliminates contracts, allows mobile payments, offers 60-day returns, and sends geo-targeted coupons, your customers will know about it. They will also expect you to do the same, or something similar, regardless of your industry segment.


This is true of business models, too. Customers adopting Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb approaches to managing the customer journey are expecting similar models from other companies. To stay competitive, businesses must monitor every entity in their customers’ ecosystem of products and brands.
Do You Have a 360-degree, 365 Days-a-Year View of Your Customer?
Because customers are dynamic, a business needs to continuously loop customer feedback into the customer journey. Without that feedback loop, no customer journey can succeed for long; it will quickly fall behind customer expectations.
According to Forrester Research, most companies make the following customer experience analytics mistakes:5

39% do not regularly ask customers about the quality of their interactions

77% do not track customer experience drivers in their organizations (which makes it difficult to know how to change even if change were possible)

72% do not track how customer experiences affect business results (which makes it difficult to get leadership buy-in to invest in improving and changing the customer experience)

79% do not share the customer experience findings they do gather with employees or leadership (thereby effectively guaranteeing that the customer experience they provide will neither improve nor change)


Businesses have responded to the dissonance in what customers want and what their companies offer by investing a great deal of time and money into creating seamless and consistently branded customer experiences across all channels. However, companies tend to monitor those channels inside-out, deriving metrics from internal key performance indicators (KPIs). They also typically report those metrics channel-by-channel (for example, web reports, store reports, call center reports), even though they have designed a holistic, omnichannel customer journey.
Siloed channel analytics can be very misleading. During focus group customer interviews, a cable company discovered that customers who dropped its service cited poor service.6 However, it also found that customers were satisfied with each channel. In the case of onboarding, there were many touchpoints (phone calls, service visits, web forms, emails, and so on), and each showed 90% satisfaction. That was pretty good. But over the course of the whole customer journey, satisfaction fell to 40%. Not so good.
In summary, each touchpoint worked well, but the whole customer experience did not because while the company was focused on optimizing touchpoints, customers engaged with the company through integrated, cross-channel journeys. The entire customer journey turned out to be less than the sum of its channel parts.
To manage and modify a customer journey, companies need to monitor customer experience holistically. However, amid all the hoopla over analytics, marketers still distrust data. They reportedly depend on data for only about one-tenth of the decisions they make about customers.7 And according to a CEB survey of 800 marketers at Fortune 1,000 companies, data-based decisions trail “conversations with managers and colleagues, expert advice, and one-off customer interactions.”8
How to Know When Your Customer Journey Starts Growing Stale
Here are some signals that your customer journey might be wearing a bit thin:
1. Customers shift channels frequently in their interactions with your firm. This indicates frustration in your channel experience.
2. Customers seek and provide information about your company or product from sources you do not control or to which you do not contribute. This indicates that your information and guidance is not complete, useful, or, in the worst-case scenario, not credible.
3. Customers go off the map, creating their own journeys from outside your company. This indicates the people, processes, interactions, and information you are providing in your journey map are not sufficient or dynamic enough to meet their needs. Your journey is too rigid.
Customers bouncing from channel to channel is not a sign your omnichannel strategy is working; our analysis shows that while brands are omnichannel, their customers are not. In a TCS analysis of retail banking channels, we discovered that customers only switch channels when their preferred one does not meet their expectations.9 We call this channel inertia. Accordingly, when your customers hop from one channel to another, this should signal that the previous channel they preferred is no longer meeting their needs, and has to adapt.
If you offer avenues for customers to resolve issues but they post complaints and seek product information from sources you do not control or contribute to, then that is a signal your journey is stale. In one case, a cable company provided and responded to customers via many traditional and digital service channels. Still, we found its customers went to Amazon for modems and WiFi range extenders, then used Amazon’s equipment review area to complain about and discuss the cable company’s customer service, not just the products they were buying from Amazon. This indicated customer problems were not being resolved within the channels the company provided.
This can be part of a larger trend that indicates your journey is stale. While off-track journeys can be opportunities for companies to meet their customer where their journey takes them, if customers research, shop, buy, and seek service outside of your journey map, then your journey map is not working for them.
The impact of out-of-date customer journey maps can be severe. The CMO Council has found that customers are more willing than ever to ditch a brand for another that offers a better experience. What is more, almost half (47%) of CMOs say they are not realizing the full revenue potential of their customers, and 49% report they need to do more to connect their internal processes with the changing customer experience. Only 16% of these CMOs felt their companies delivered a customer experience that fulfilled their brand’s promise.10
How to Keep Up With the Accelerating Pace of Customer Expectations
So what can companies do to keep their customer journeys competitive? The story of a large retailer is instructive here. Earlier this decade, with a customer base composed mostly of women with children, the chain wanted to bring mobile technology and social media into its customer journey. However, it first needed to know exactly how its customers used them. After using CRM, surveys, and social analytics, the retailer realized it was dealing with four unique behavioral segments. We will simply refer to them as Segments A, B, C, and D.
Let us take a look at Segment C. By collecting data on each segment’s mobile and social behaviors along each stage of the customer journey, the retailer discovered 68% of Segment C used a mobile device to shop for deals (many also used catalogs), and 73% discussed products with other mothers through social media channels.
The awareness stage was often kicked off by an SMS message from family and friends informing shoppers in Segment C of an upcoming special event (a birthday, a graduation, and so on). She then visited the retailer’s mobile website, and searched the catalog. She browsed the store’s shelves, used her PC to compare prices on the web, asked family and friends about options and deals, checked out product reviews on her mobile while she was in the store, and on her PC when she returned home. In the selection phase, she filled multiple carts from competitors, but often abandoned her online carts.
Coupons and point-of-sale add-ons were critical to Segment C customers in the purchase stage, and sometimes she would put off a purchase until a better deal emerged.
Based on this level of persona profiling and the associated customer journeys, the retailer invested in more than four dozen digital programs to develop the capabilities for improving engagement with all these moms. These programs included enhancing mobile search capabilities and creating a mobile app with an embedded loyalty program that offered coupons and calendar reminders of special events in the shopper’s children’s lives. The retailer built out its in-store WiFi. It launched an intense SMS marketing program with SMS coupons, SMS shipping alerts (and SMS abandoned cart alerts), while instituting an easier return program.
All that happened earlier this decade. But much has changed since then: in mobile-social technology, processes, functions, shopper preferences, and behavior. In the Segment C shoppers’ ‘awareness of need’ phase of the customer journey, mobile web and shopping apps have become more popular than SMS. Fewer customers are visiting stores, and more are making purchases from mobile phones. More internet users of all types are on tablet computers and fewer use PCs.
Had the retailer stuck with a picture of its customer journeys taken just a few years ago, it would have had challenges. The lesson here is that companies must monitor their customer experience KPIs as often as needed in their industry to ensure the customer journeys—and the initiatives based on them—are still on track. We say ‘in their industry’ because our customer research across industries shows us that the pace of customer change varies by industry. You need to begin with test data collection and analytics to benchmark how frequently key decision criteria is changing in your industry’s key segments.
Benchmarking your unique Industry Customer Change Cycle will also inform many other aspects of your customer experience efforts: How often can you successfully introduce new features and functions? How often can customers consume new messaging? What is the right timing for new product releases? What changes most frequently, so where should you prepare and operationalize for change? Is it product, messaging, pricing, or service?
Deploying Dynamic Customer Journey Maps
Understanding the change is the first requirement; building systems, processes, and training people to adapt quickly to customer change is the second. Companies will need to shift to dynamic customer journey mapping and its attendant technologies to adjust them quickly.
A great example of such mapping can be seen at U.K. supermarket giant Tesco. Tesco continually analyzes its 13 million loyalty card customers’ purchasing data.11 Using what it calls Recency, Frequency, Value analysis, it scores customers on how often they shop, the items they purchase, and their spending. With this analysis, Tesco creates personal experiences for different shoppers, customizing offerings for each segment.
While Tesco primarily focused on dynamic loyalty personalization, the end-game is to be able to adjust any aspect, any step in the journey based on customer experience analytics.
Dynamic customer journey mapping should leverage workflow orchestration across functions and systems, with continuous customer experience monitoring that can trigger adjustments in the journey. Early examples of this capability can be seen in Salesforce and Pegasystems platforms (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Automatic Responses to Customer Actions Makes for a Dynamic Customer Journey
Salesforce Journey Builder is a first step in Dynamic Customer Journey Mapping and Management. Journey Builder allows automatic responses to customer actions such as purchases, clicks, and email opens. And it is cross channel: It orchestrates email, SMS, push notifications, ads, web, and apps among wireless service providers shifted on a monthly basis.
Perhaps the most powerful tool available to help companies respond quickly to changes in their customers’ purchase criteria will be artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, a media company with high customer turnover revamped its analytics using a neural network to predict which customers were preparing to leave so it could address the problem proactively. The analytics accuracy in predicting churn was between 75% and 90%, and every percentage point of churn reduction added millions of dollars to the company’s bottom line.12
The need for more intelligent applications and advice is nowhere more acute than in customer experience.
Creating an Agile Customer Journey
Companies that can change their messaging, offerings, pricing, and channels at the speed their customer needs change will be winners. Companies must take two big steps to establish such agile customer journeys:
STEP 1.
Create an infrastructure—people, process, platform, and data—responsive to the insight you retrieve.
For example, by linking data directly from search to operations, Google can change an ad almost instantly, without human facilitation.
STEP 2.
Monitor behavior at the pace of change and feed insights directly into action.
Google updates ad positioning continuously according to an ads relevance to an individual search. The better the position, the higher the click-through rate, producing more revenue for Google and the businesses buying ads. This is a virtuous circle that creates value for both parties because Google automatically maps its updates to the changing customer journey.
How do you know your customers are changing faster than you are? You are losing customers and market share. That is a dead giveaway that you are not meeting their needs. Do not wait until they have left to make a change.
Perhaps you do not know how often they change, you thought you did, but that was yesterday. They have changed since then, have you?
This a challenge that every business needs to address. If the customer journey it designed yesterday does not meet the customer experience needs and purchase criteria of its customers today, every problem the business has—customer churn, declining market share, falling revenue or profits—will certainly get worse tomorrow.

10,"The transition of enterprise apps to the cloud model has moved from an ‘if‘ question to a ‘how’ question—how to do it quickly and expertly? ERP software leaders such as Oracle and SAP are squarely focused on giving customers the right product and service mix for their cloud transitions and for their digital business transformations. While these are mission-critical applications at the heart of the business, transition speed is of the essence. As businesses transform to digital enterprises, the lengthy ERP software implementations of the past do not fly. Business model changes, product innovations, and customer service improvements have to happen quickly. The company that ignores this reality will watch its rivals, both established companies and nimble up-and-comers, race right by.
For companies to capitalize on cloud-based enterprise systems, they must significantly reduce the time it took in the past to implement traditional enterprise systems. However, one size or approach still does not suit all companies in the cloud environment: many use hybrid solutions that combine on-premises and cloud tools, and even within cloud, companies have the option of public versus private cloud model approaches.
The right tools and techniques help companies ensure successful, fast implementations of cloud-based enterprise systems and harmonize them as needed with existing installed systems.
Among the key elements for companies seeking cloud transition speed—a new approach to gathering requirements and doing testing, a willingness to use automation tools and standardized processes, and a willingness to look at cloud tools as part of a holistic technology strategy that includes mobile and analytics tools. Leaders of today’s effective enterprise software projects stay focused on digital business goals and seek out ways to reach them faster.
Where Traditional Approaches Fall Short
Companies are moving away from the on-premises model for ERP apps and to the cloud model for several reasons, related to business digital transformation. In the past, the best product at the right price typically won the marketplace, but today, speed to market and agility win, as customers press for continuous innovation. Thus companies face unprecedented pressure to transform business processes and business models—and do so at high speed.
This kind of marketplace speed creates heightened business expectations for ERP software tools. At a time when Amazon can make hundreds of changes to its core business systems in a week, business teams want more from their own ERP systems. IT’s reputation, as the department of ‘no’, must evolve for a digital business to thrive.
Companies also have a newfound need for agility. When companies free up cash by shifting from the CapEx-intensive, on-premises IT model to an OpEx model with cloud services, this adds flexibility. In turn, this flexibility can speed a company’s time to market for new products and services.
Finally, a digital business seeks to share the newest data (even real-time data) broadly throughout the organization, to enable faster decision-making. Yesterday’s ERP tools were not designed with that mindset. However, broad access to data goes hand-in-hand with cloud and mobile technologies. For all these reasons, companies are taking a critical look at which cloud-based ERP tools could help them solve key business problems.
A Fresh Approach
How are companies embarking on this significant software transition with an eye to speed? Keys to a successful enterprise software cloud transition include a new approach to requirements, openness to automation, speedier testing, attention to data migration and tool coexistence, iterating during software development work, and taking a holistic technology approach focused on business goals.
For many companies, the solution involves a hybrid cloud approach, for example, involving a customer’s private cloud, Oracle-provided cloud services and third-party cloud services. In another example, SAP is making it easier for customers to run its S/4HANA apps on public cloud services. The right planning and tools can ensure cloud-based tools and remaining on-premises tools coexist productively.
Let us delve into the keys to success, starting with a new approach to the requirements process.
In the traditional, on-premises software world this process starts with gathering requirements from customers and trying to map to the on-premises product to those business wishes. In the cloud world, the requirements process is product-led. Fast companies choose to use best-in-class business processes available via cloud tools, instead of doing tons of customization work.
For example, U.S. financial company TD Bank did a 2015 project to solve HR-related business problems. The company’s HR information was too distributed, since regional HR apps kept data siloed. Also, each region had its own HR processes, creating inefficiencies. Seeking to reduce TCO around HR, the company chose to move to Oracle HCM Cloud. The company utilized Oracle HCM’s standardized HR processes for workforce compensation, saving implementation time. Embedded analytics helped the company define individual software dashboards for various employee roles.
Next, companies should look for opportunities to use automation tools and pre-configured tools wherever possible, for example, business process frameworks for particular industries. Automation can significantly speed the configuration process, doing tasks that once required weeks of hands-on work from IT.
For example, South African telecomm company Cell C transitioned from on-premises Oracle software to cloud-based versions in 2016, with two business goals—enabling an online education curriculum to improve employee engagement and thus decrease turnover rates; and shifting software licensing costs from CapEx to OpEx. For implementation speed, Cell C used a TCS configuration tool to realize a 25% to 30% reduction in implementation time (compared to industry average benchmarks from Oracle) and a 10% business process improvement (as it got rid of extraneous business processes).
Pre-configured transition tools can also assist companies in industry verticals when there is a functional gap between the Oracle on-premises and cloud products. For example, a tool for employee engagement plugs into Oracle HCM SaaS, allowing bi-directional communication with employees. In another example, you may need to add a procurement solution for tasks like comparing products, using information from social media and product websites. For companies moving to a tool like Oracle HCM cloud, it is important to know where such functional gaps are, in order to address them and keep the project’s go-live date on track. (TCS has pre-built solutions to fill in these functional gaps, built on Oracle PaaS.)
ERP implementations involve considerable testing, of course, but automation tools can help here as well. For example, to shorten the testing cycle on Oracle implementations, an automated testing tool can cut a four to six week testing cycle to a few days to two weeks. Another benefit of automated test tools, in a cloud implementation, Oracle offers customers new feature functionality in small drops, every two to three months. With each drop, the customer has to test again to ensure compatibility. Automated test scripts speed up the work. The same is true for Oracle patches.
Data migration and on-premises tool co-existence matter significantly to companies pursuing speedy transitions. Getting data from existing systems into the new cloud-based system is perhaps the most underestimated task in these projects, requiring much time, energy, and effort. Companies should seek opportunities to speed repetitive tasks here in particular. For example, a retailer that was rapidly adding stores in Asia used TCS QuickConfig utility to reduce the time needed to add a new store into the company’s SAP ERP system from eight to nine days to a few hours.
Cloud ERP transitions often happen in pieces, targeting focused digital business problems. Companies do not have to tackle all the data at once. In TD Bank’s case, mentioned earlier, the company wanted to keep using PeopleSoft 9.2 software for all other HR functions other than workforce compensation. So, the TCS Oracle Cloud Integration Layer was used to integrate the Oracle HCM Cloud tool with PeopleSoft tools, giving the bank a fruitful on-premises/cloud tools coexistence.
In another example, Global Glory, an ATM manufacturer, sought an Oracle cloud-based tool but only for supply chain work. The company uses on-premises J.D. Edwards software tools for all other ERP functions. To save time during this 2016 project, Global Glory leveraged TCS pre-built adapters (built on Oracle’s Integrated Cloud Services on PaaS) for on-premises products like J.D. Edwards and PeopleSoft. (Oracle’s ICS offering lacks the pre-built adapters.) Pre-built equaled time saved for the company.
Where are the time sinks on your cloud tools migration roadmap? Take a close look at what preconfigured and automated tools exist to conquer those issues.
Make Way for Iteration
Along with these keys to success, companies that achieve speedy transitions to cloud tools use some elements of the agile development approach (not a sequential, waterfall approach). Iteration is central to the agile approach.
As part of this effort, business teams should see the end stage goal for the software very early in the development cycle. (In the old world, months or years of work would happen before business users saw a skeleton of the software interface that they would be using.) Today, business goals change, regulations change, people change, too quickly for that old world development model. The business could get stuck with a big disconnect by the time software development work ends. An iterative approach allows development teams to adjust rapidly to changes.
Looking ahead to the future, companies will have access to additional techniques to further speed such implementations. For example, visualization technology can help companies with testing assumptions about ERP implementations. TCS, in concert with academic researchers, is experimenting with some companies to do simulations of ERP implementations, and gamify the simulations.
Here is how it works: teams use an ERP simulator tool to construct a business model, say for selling a product like cereal. The simulator fast-forwards quarters and years to show how each business model choice plays out for the business. The team that produces the most revenue and profit, and least leftover inventory, wins the exercise. In a short amount of time, a business team can visualize how an ERP plan will succeed or fail. It is easy to envision both startups and established companies finding value from such simulations.
Dealing with Speed Bumps
Even companies that commit to trying tools and techniques like the ones explored above can face significant speed hurdles during transitions to cloud-based ERP tools.
First, companies can not underestimate the importance of user experience to the success of these projects. Usability can still be a factor with ERP tools. With SAP for example, the user interface for cloud-based tools is still in transition and can pose a barrier for quick user acceptance of the software.
In ERP, the focus traditionally has been on business processes—user experience played a subordinate role. But today, in the age of mobile and handheld devices, we all expect more from software tools and their UI. That is another reason to ensure business users see what they are getting for UI early in the development process.
Second, companies can suffer from a lack of business focus during cloud transition projects. The companies that fail at ERP implementations are typically the ones that try to do everything all at once for the business. The companies that succeed are the ones who know where to focus. TD Bank, for example, zeroed in on inefficient HR processes and siloed HR data and correcting those problems, before they became a competitive, operational, or financial liability.
Companies need a clear roadmap of desired digital business outcomes so the ERP plan can be matched up to it and executed accordingly. This also requires true respect for technology project scope. If you keep the scope fluid, the quick path to the business outcome can vanish.
Third, moving ERP tools to a cloud model requires a great deal of change management inside the organization. Given the mission-critical status of these tools, support from the top proves crucial. The CEO needs to invest time to make sure everyone understands how this ERP software change furthers the company business strategy. Additionally, transitions of this sort may create significant cultural upheaval within the IT department, which cannot be ignored. IT’s role changes in the cloud-based model, offloading administration tasks and freeing up time for business innovation work. But what exactly does the new SaaS product handle? What does IT handle? What does your systems integrator handle? For some companies, IT’s role is still evolving. Strong executive support for IT’s role in the digital business transformation is mandatory.

Finally, companies that make this transition quickly fight the urge to customize too much. This represents a big change for managing ERP tools. For decades, business has dictated requirements and customization was widely expected. Now, in the interest of speed, companies opt for more standardized business processes. How do you know where to draw the lines around what still deserves to be customized? Some companies will set limits around customization tied to revenue; for example, setting rules such as “if the business process affects less than $5 million in revenue, we will not customize it. If the business process affects more, we will review it for possible customization.” But the bottom line is that any customization requires a strong business rationale.
Acting On the Big Picture
Today’s default business model is a digital business model. Thus, to be competitive, companies must take a holistic view of technology and shape a clear roadmap to the digital model. Cloud transitions and cloud strategy should be considered integral to the overall digital business journey. Winning companies consider mobility and analytics along with cloud transitions, and not as an afterthought.
Additionally, business user expectations of enterprise software tools will only grow, and your rivals can and will use their ability to move fast with these tools as a competitive advantage. So it is time to let go of older ideas about the requirements process, testing, and data migration that will slow down implementations. Use automation tools as much as possible and stress an iterative approach.
As you explore where any functional gaps exist between the on-premises and cloud ERP tools, seek out data analysis tools to solve related business problems. For example, during this part of its cloud migration work, chip manufacturer Knowles solved a quality issue where faults on chips were surfacing too late in the production process. By staying ruthlessly focused on digital business goals, companies can make the most of critical software transitions.

11,"The competitive digital business landscape is forcing organizations to become better at recognizing the workforce skills they will need, well before they need them. When companies become reactive in filling key jobs, they have a hard time securing critical talent at the moment of need. The result is they lose out on key hires to companies that have articulated their talent requirements.
However, to keep good people and identify the new crop that companies will need, HR executives will have to let go of many traditional hiring and retention practices–methods established at a time when detailed, up-to-date information on employee value, attitudes and company job needs were either missing or locked up in file cabinets stuffed with paper records.
How can big companies better anticipate the next wave of skills they will need, and retain their rising stars, amidst intense competition for the best people? In this article, I will explain methods that TCS—with more than 350,000 employees around the world today, nearly six times the number of 10 years ago, and other companies have used to retain the best people, as well as hire new ones before there is a run on them.
My advice is that many companies need to rethink traditional ideas about recruiting and hiring, stress the business value of internal training, and make the HR organization more agile. HR executives, in particular, have an unprecedented opportunity to help business unit managers solve two of their biggest talent challenges: retaining their most valuable employees and determining what new skills they will soon need before competitors do.
The Talent Crunch
Across industries and around the world, big companies have truly been in a war for talent since the great recession began to recede about seven years ago. A key reason for the acute talent shortages in certain domains, in addition to the rebounding world economy, is that digital technologies have been redefining jobs in every business function.
Let us consider the marketing function. Five years ago, many companies did not have marketers heading areas such as social media, search engine optimization, mobile applications, marketing analytics, and online customer communities. Today, those positions are commonplace and often go begging for talent. Ann Lewnes, chief marketing officer at $4.8 billion1 marketing software firm Adobe Systems Inc., put it this way: “The rise of new digital technologies has caused upheaval for many industries, and the marketing profession has been in the eye of that storm, too.” Adobe’s 2015 survey of more than 6,000 marketers and e-commerce professionals across industries, and around the world found they have seen more changes in marketing in the last two years than in the last 50 years.2 In addition, of the 25 hottest skills of 2015, LinkedIn found four of the top ten were related to marketing: marketing campaign management, SEO, mobile development, and user interface design.3
Digital technologies have also created acute skills shortages in the IT function. There has been a run on talent in such hot technology domains as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and big data and analytics. The market for a key digital business role—analytics and big data—remains particularly hot, as evidenced by a high number of candidates switching jobs. In 2015, 20% of analytics professionals and data scientists switched jobs.4 Overall, 32% of U.S. employers and 38% of global employers had difficulties filling job vacancies due to talent shortages.5
Many conventional HR tactics and tools were not designed for the pace of digital business. Today’s workforce predictive analytics software can help companies cope to an extent. Companies are using it to predict what skills they will need. They can be proactive in talent acquisition and development to plan the basics of recruiting, training, and infrastructure development.
Accurate forecasting, based on predicted attrition rates and business growth forecasts for departments, helps a company prepare for growth and predict future talent needs. But using this software is table stakes, not a competitive differentiator.
So how do large organizations hold onto their best people? How do they identify new skills they will need just over the horizon? The HR practices of one of America’s biggest banks, Wells Fargo, are instructive.
How Wells Fargo Goes Beyond Traditional HR Tactics and Tools
Some companies are thinking more critically and creatively about how to apply these tools. Take Wells Fargo & Co., America’s third largest bank.6 While the bank uses analytics to assess the impact of employee turnover, but it focuses on the quality of turnover–that is, who exactly is leaving the organization.7 “Because all employees are different, we cannot count their turnover the same,” said Kathy Doan, vice president of community banking HR insights and analytics, whose team advises senior HR leaders at a unit of Wells Fargo that has more than 100,000 employees.8 “If you think about it, what will hurt a baseball club more: losing a Cy Young award winning pitcher or losing a designated hitter? We have business leaders interested in applying this quality of turnover concept to identify areas that have high attrition risk.”
Accurate forecasting, based on predicted attrition rates and business growth forecasts for departments, helps a company prepare for growth and predict future talent needs.
Doan advises HR executives to use predictive modeling to assess which of their company’s valued employees are ready to leave. That, in turn, requires using a range of data—for example, how long they have been in their jobs, their satisfaction score on the company engagement survey, and their job performance. As she wrote, “Would it not be great if you knew that an employee who has been in his or her job for six months has an overall satisfaction score of 3.25 on the engagement survey, and is meeting 80% of their productivity goals has a 75% chance of leaving the company?”9 Wells Fargo is also exploring the use of text mining of social media to predict when an employee may leave the company.
Despite the turbulence in the banking industry, Wells Fargo was the 10th most valuable American company by market value, and the most valuable bank, at the end of 2015.10 Clearly, it is succeeding in the digital era. In companies like Wells Fargo, HR has become an invaluable adviser to senior management about talent, especially about who is likely to leave but who must be retained, and the new skills the organization will require next. That requires supplying the necessary data, tools, and executive support.
Talent Approaches That Work
So how can your company get there? Here are several key strategies for winning the talent race.
Developing Your Employees
The best companies we have seen at retaining talent and discerning upcoming skill needs stress internal development and cross-training. The reason is simple: they can kill two birds with one stone. By training the people who already work for them, these companies are more likely to retain valuable employees who are looking for new learning opportunities.
At the same time, they begin the search for people with new key skills internally rather than externally. In other words, these companies check first to see if they can ‘groom their own’. Developing new skills in employees is a key employee retention tool. Rotate people from project-to-project, to experience new technologies, vertical industries, and cultural environments. Such an approach develops people in a holistic manner for a digital business. This requires good communication between leaders and their teams in order to understand individual goals and career options.
Exactly how do HR leaders make internal skills development effective? Companies continue to need the traditional classroom style programs. However, more and more, they need to train people through online learning tools. They allow employees to learn around the clock from wherever they are, to address specific knowledge gaps, or emerging technology skills.
Experience is just as important; people need to practice what they have learned. If they will not immediately be deployed to use the knowledge, create an internal project where they can practice the new material. Also, develop partner alliances wherein you can feed talent through the partner’s pipeline to practice new skills.
Screening People for Their Ability to Continually Learn and Other Soft Skills
If the efforts described above sound like a big commitment to internal training and development, rest assured that they are. And they are more than just a financial commitment. They also require senior business, and HR executives to shift their thinking about key competencies. That is our second key talent strategy—hiring people for their ability to embrace continual learning.
Today’s digital businesses must prioritize hiring people who not only have the right skills and knowledge but also show a proclivity to learn new skills and knowledge. That has become crucial at a time when digital technologies are dramatically reducing the lifespan of knowledge and skills. In other words, much conventional wisdom does not remain wise as long as it used to.
Other soft skills: attitude, emotional intelligence, maturity, and the ability to work in a collaborative environment are more important than ever, at a time when business models shift frequently and new initiatives launch at high speed. Such personal attributes and aptitude should have a greater weight in hiring decisions than specific skills.
Screening More Rigorously
Applying equal screening weight for both hard and soft skills is crucial today. So has conducting more rigorous background checks, which is the third talent strategy. For example, in addition to traditional screening, a growing number of organizations are going online to check out the social media postings of potential employees. In the U.S., nearly four out of ten companies (39%) used social media in 2015 to screen potential employees, more than double the number (18%) in 2011, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.11
Bringing Brand Management to Campus
Our fourth strategy is one your marketers will embrace: strengthening your company’s brand at colleges and universities. Every company today needs a brand image that makes college graduates want to come and join them. Large companies that have been around for decades compete against venture capital funded firms whose digital products are often the envy of new members of the workforce.
While your company may not be able to tap the ‘cool factor’ that such startups can offer, you can capitalize on other strengths. One is building a presence on campuses that long predates the days you recruit there. Offer learning materials to the universities for use in class. It is beneficial not only for your future hires to have this knowledge, but also for the industry workforce as a whole. Establishing labs within universities—as TCS has done in India and at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and other universities in the U.S.—also builds a company’s reputation with the university community, including potential new hires, and their professors and mentors.
Procter & Gamble has long done this with universities in its headquarters state of Ohio to feed its pipeline of talent. So has statistics software company SAS, with North Carolina State University, near its headquarters in Cary.12 The focus of the SAS/N.C. State research partnership includes cyber security, big data, text analytics, data visualization and sensors, and health monitoring technologies—all highly sought after employment skills.
As companies seek to attract, retain, and continually invest in possible university recruits, raising visibility is crucial. Some companies use hackathons and contests. They are not just for technology recruits. For example, TCS organizes several kinds of hackathons, and contests for predicting product reliability, and constructing business cases. The EngineX contest, primarily for mechanical engineering students, is aimed at solving problems in a factory or in product development.
In the U.S., nearly four out of ten companies (39%) used social media in 2015 to screen potential employees, more than double the number (18%) in 2011.
Gamified learning and hiring processes can also help. TCS has a ‘campus commune’ portal where students join and can create communities around common interests, as on other social networks, with TCS experts available to discuss topics or case studies. In the TCS Aspire program, new hires get gamified material as they prepare to join TCS, where they earn badges for milestones.
Using Digital Technology to Hire and Screen
Hiring has become a high-tech enterprise. Companies that are digital businesses, or running fast to become one, must root out hiring inefficiencies. For instance, social networks such as LinkedIn will make much of today’s human scanning of resumes obsolete in a few years. You cannot only spot industry domain knowledge, but also sense whether a person’s history and goals culturally fit with your organization. Is social media a key hiring tool for your company? If not, it must become one.
Additionally, businesses must pay closer attention to using analytics tools. If your company has poor business analytics, it is hard for HR to see how the organization will grow in the future—what skills it has and what skills it will need.
Many HR departments have risen to this challenge. One is the $50 billion U.K. based consumer goods company Unilever. CEO Paul Polman insists that business analytics and HR analytics should be tightly married, given the company’s ambitious sales growth targets (doubling revenue). Unilever’s chief HR officer, Doug Baillie, sees such alignment as a ‘distinctive strength,’ as he explained in a recent industry association white paper.13 “We have spent an enormous amount of time examining whether we have the talent engine to sustain an 80 billion euros revenue business. … This is one of the essential roles HR plays in the business by ensuring any gaps in the skills, talent or culture across the business that might harm our 80 billion euro aspirations are covered.”
To Unilever, designing a talent strategy to help execute its growth strategy has been powerful.
Marketing the Brand Broadly as a Great Place Work
The college campus is not the only place for companies to create a strong employer brand. They should use other channels as well. Conference speaking is one, and an industry alliance partnership is another. Along the same lines pay attention to the message your own website sends to possible hires. It may be highly attractive to customers. But is it as appealing to future employees?
In addition to traditional hiring techniques such as employee referrals (still an important tool) investigate emerging ones. For instance, can you use a platform where candidates can present themselves, and discuss their interest in a role using a short video clip?
Finally, consider using innovation hubs as a way to draw prized talent, say around robotics or IoT skills. General Motors uses four U.S. innovation centers to draw IT talent, especially from local universities. Part of the lure is the chance to work with emerging technologies and digital business projects.14
A decade ago, a number of big companies such as Unilever, P&G, and Shell started focusing as much on their employer brand as they had for years on their customer brand, according to the employer branding firm Universum.15 Since then, as the firm points out, social media has given employees the ability to broadcast what it is really like to work at a certain company. This means companies must pay far more attention to engaging with employees and making them advocates.
Barriers to Success
What are the common mistakes companies make as they try to improve their talent game? Many companies see the value in doing cross-training; fewer actually execute it well. If you cross-train someone and do not put that knowledge in action, the training becomes useless. Companies must find ways to help employees apply the new skills.
Second, companies need strong executive support for training and tweaking hiring practices. For example, if you are hiring for curiosity rather than for skills, the CEO must stress the value of quick learners as critical to company’s digital goals. This helps fight cultural resistance.
Third, many of us have watched companies focus on hiring at the expense of retention. But retention is more crucial than ever. To keep valued employees, companies must offer multiple career paths, along with leadership development opportunities.
Coaching and mentoring are key to retention. The best companies personally connect with talented individuals, empathize with them, and give them exposure to the right levels of leadership to showcase their potential as future leaders. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs can help too: participating in social programs such as community development work has consistently proven to boost an employer’s brand with employees.
Recruits notice CSR efforts. Some 79% weigh a company’s CSR commitments when deciding where to work, according to one study.16 In-demand analytics and big data professionals are showing an increasing interest in CSR, another study found out.17
HR’s Future: A Digital Business Partner
In the future, while automation tools will help with the transactional aspects of HR, the people aspect of HR will not go away. Today and tomorrow, much HR activity (coaching, critiquing, identifying rising leaders) is done by the business line managers themselves. HR provides necessary training and support for these managers. More than ever, HR should not be seen as an island, but as a partner to the business teams.
Yet HR must also continue to improve its own processes for hiring and retaining valued employees. Take a lesson from the agile, iterative approach at startups. The HR organization of a big company should constantly evaluate itself. Is a particular hiring or retention approach still providing value to the organization? If not, kill it quickly. Constantly question how your HR team’s talent strategies benefit the business, and continue to improve or discard them to improve results.
The HR departments that help companies identify, secure, motivate, and retain the talent they need in the years ahead will be considered key engines of growth. In the most successful digital businesses, such HR functions are already playing that role.

12,"For some time, many senior executives have focused on providing superior customer experiences through innovative combinations of ‘bricks’ and ‘clicks’. They tell us their goal is to provide a CX that is better than (or at least on a par with) their leading competitors. It’s a laudable target, even if it has eluded most for decades. But what they don’t realize is that they may be chasing the wrong benchmarks. The next big CX breakthrough is more likely to come from outside their walls and digital channels than from within them.
Examples abound of new entrants that revolutionize the CX standard in an industry, disrupting the competitive status quo, and quickly capturing market share. An outsider, a Silicon Valley startup named Uber, used an app to create a revolutionary CX in the taxi industry which well-established players are still struggling to match. A computer maker, Apple, used mobile checkouts, in-store experts (the Genius bar), and onsite seminars to reinvent the CX in consumer electronics retailing. Two software executives created Netflix’s mail and later, streaming services for movies, sounding the death knell of the video rental store CX.
These examples show why company leaders must look beyond their industry’s borders in search of new CX models. To do this, they must focus more on the outcomes their customers are seeking and less on how they and their current competitors are delivering those outcomes.
The Currency of CX is Outcomes
Today, companies more than ever need to consider the outcomes that customers desire in dealing with them. The many new experiential options enabled by digital technologies and social media are causing customers to question the outcomes that their current suppliers provide.
Today, customers set their expectations based upon interaction (and consumption of products and services) with lots of other companies in any given industry.
By outcomes, we mean the customers’ goal or desired result in doing business with you. For example, a customer outcome might be to simplify a complex task. It’s one reason why Quicken Loan’s Rocket Mortgage, which can finance a home purchase in less than 10 minutes,1 has taken off. (Rocket Mortgage accounted for $7 billion of the $96 billion in home loans that Quicken funded in 2016, which would make it one of the 30 largest mortgage companies in the U.S.)2 Another outcome is the need to receive a product or service with less hassle—a reason why millions of us now use Uber and Lyft rather than stand in long taxi lines or jockey for position to flag down cabs on busy corners. Other outcomes might include a less contentious shopping experience (think CarMax in buying used autos) or fast, easy installation of new purchases (e.g., Best Buy’s Geek Squad). Such outcomes are always a value to the end customer, and at the moment of need.
The burgeoning number of financial technology startups is a notable manifestation of this trend. In retail banking, customers are abandoning neighborhood banks for internet-based banks. In commercial banking, customers are questioning the value of relationship managers. Across consumer, corporate, and institutional banking sectors, customers are asking, “Is my financial provider getting me the results I need or is there a better way to achieve them?”
Companies need to think about CX from a customer outcome-based perspective, and then look at the best practices of companies outside their industry to reinvent how they deliver those outcomes. Some executives, including Joe Foley, chief marketing officer of Unum Group, an insurance company with $11 billion in annual revenue, are already doing this. “Today, customers set their expectations based upon interaction (and consumption of products and services) with lots of other companies in any given industry,” Foley told Forbes in 2015.3 “It’s really set by what they’ve come to expect across the universal spectrum of customer service in their personal lives.”4
Understanding the outcomes that customers desire is not always a straightforward task. But fundamentals—basic truths about customer outcomes—exist across the spectrum of CX possibilities that can help executives define the outcomes that matter most to their company’s customers.
Four CX Truths
There are four truths about delivering superlative CX that apply to every industry today and for the foreseeable future.
1. Not all customers want the same experience, but all might want a similar outcome.
The outcomes customers desire are shaped by their distinctive wants. For instance, Ryanair and Singapore Airlines are both in the business of flying customers from point A to B. But the outcomes their customers desire are very different. What Ryanair’s customers want is a low fare, while customers of Singapore Airlines (with its premium service model) desire something very different. Both airlines are successfully transporting their customers but delivering a different CX to their customers. The lesson? Different CXs are required for different customer segments.
2. Customers want to acquire products and services as efficiently as possible.
This is why Amazon has built vast warehouses across the U.S., and why it is now seeking to make the order-to-delivery process even more efficient by using delivery drones and taking orders via its AI assistant Echo. “In our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection,” says CEO Jeff Bezos.5
This truth also explains why many retailers are struggling to get bricks-and-clicks right. The ‘bricks’ part of the experience continues to be far too inefficient. Many consumers now order items online and pick them up in a store. Yet, as a TCS 2016 survey revealed, they are often left disappointed by long lines and ill-informed store personnel.6
3. Customers will only do business with ‘bricks’ companies that offer a unique, value-laden CX.
If physical stores are to remain viable in the digital era, two conditions must be met: The CX they offer must be one that can’t be done as well (or at all) online, and it must provide compelling value to customers. If either condition is unmet, customers will skip ‘bricks’ and gravitate to companies that deliver the best online CX. Additionally, the bricks must be part of an overall customer value proposition, one in which there is synergy between the bricks and the clicks. Apple excels in this model.
This truth has many retail banks worried. They know that the experience of their physical branches is not compelling enough to stop online-only banks from siphoning off customers. But there are lessons from other industries that can be instructive. Apple, for example, built a $28 billion a year retail business, in part by offering an experience that wasn’t available from online consumer electronics retailers, including repairing its products on premises via its Genius Bars. Apple’s online site provides customers with first-level chatting and problem solving that they can easily escalate to making an appointment with the Genius Bar in an Apple store, while having the online interactions available to the Genius Bar technician when they arrive. Outdoors gear retailer REI erected rock-climbing walls in its stores, and Barnes & Noble holds live readings and concerts, in addition to providing access to Starbucks shops in its bookstores, creating an intimate, high-touch, wraparound CX.
The CX they offer must be one that can’t be done as well (or at all) online, and it must provide compelling value to customers.
4. Customers expect the CX to improve continuously.
Today, after customers do business with a company, they expect that it will a) recognize them and know their history of transactions, and b) provide value-added insights, support, new offerings based on this recognition, and a timeline of interactions.
Again, Amazon provides a benchmark. “Amazon owns the richest data set on how consumers consume, how sellers sell, and (among the richest) how (software developers) develop,” explains market research firm CB Insights. “This, in turn, allows Amazon to optimize its online shopping experience, its logistics network, and development environment (and even its voice AI), which all, in turn, make Amazon’s offerings even richer.”7
First Steps in CX Enhancement
Once you understand these fundamental CX truths, and the outcomes your customers are seeking when they do business with your company, we advise taking these steps:
Recognize where CX fits within the overall company offering and basis of competition within your specific industry, and ensure your management is aligned. If CX is not a competitive differentiator for your company, following the best practices within your industry may suffice. But if CX is critical to your company’ success, you must ensure that your whole management team is united in the quest to deliver it. If the CEO says CX is a strategic priority, but the head of customer service only cares about maximizing the number of calls the contact center’s reps can handle per day, your company will not be able to deliver on its CX promises. One of the biggest CX obstacles we see in established companies is a lack of alignment among management layers. Digital firms like Amazon and upstarts like Uber often have an advantage here: Their management has always focused on CX and understands that their unique CX model is how they differentiate.
Focus not just on the experience you want customers to have with your offerings, but also the feeling you wish to create about those offerings. Retailers like Starbucks are masters in branding such images. Financial services firms are just beginning to experiment with it.
Look outside your sector for companies that provide great customer experiences. Carnival Cruise Lines looked to a theme park, Walt Disney World, to revamp its CX, and hired a Disney World executive who had led a $1 billion theme park experience initiative. Now, reach out further: if your company is B2B, look at B2C companies, and vice versa.
Determine how CX affects key business metrics. You won’t know if your CX efforts are successful unless you know how they affect revenue, customer retention, cost-to-serve, reputation, and other key performance metrics. Only then can you establish a baseline for CX measurement and improvement—for instance, how faster time-to-resolution in customer service impacts cost-to-serve and repeat purchases.
Manage CX holistically. The best CX providers understand that their entire portfolio of activities—including products, pricing, and promotion—affects the customer experience. Moreover, CX is not only determined by your customer-facing operations (stores, websites, and call centers), but also by everything that goes on behind them. That’s why the performance objectives in functions throughout the organization must include, and be aligned with, CX excellence.
Monitor CX hot spots. Monitor the areas of your business that offer the most positive and negative CX, and whenever they flash red, identify and resolve problems quickly. In stores, for example, checkout lines are a CX hot spot; in theme parks or sports stadiums, the waiting lines for restrooms are a common hot spot.
Maintain a laser-like focus on influencers and other high-profile customers. These days, customer feedback can burnish or tarnish a brand at digital speed. It is critical to track social media and understand its impact on existing and potential customers. Identify and cultivate influential customers who promote your company. And when your company receives a nasty-gram or email, know who sent it, the size of the sender’s audience, and the sender’s propensity to share negative experiences before responding.
Look Out for CX Excellence
The race to deliver more compelling and innovative customer experiences is on in both ‘bricks’ and ‘clicks’ companies, and the firms that offer both. By looking beyond their competitors and their own industries for breakthrough ideas, leaders can help their companies become frontrunners in the CX race.
These winners will move quickly, iterating the CX rapidly, seeking continuous innovation and improvement to navigate markets, testing technologies, and exceeding customer expectations that are changing so quickly that there is no finish line.
The bottom line: Leave behind what traditionally has been thought in providing a good customer experience and figure out the differentiating business outcomes and corresponding time value you want to provide your customers. Move as fast as possible to address and iterate these because speed is of the essence in the CX race, and your customers are staying ahead of you.

13,"For better or for worse, depending on your view about technology’s impact on employment, artificial intelligence has long been seen as a technology to help companies do more things with fewer people. That is a key part of making companies ‘lighter,’ as we refer to it in this issue of TCS Perspectives—to run and grow a business without having a geometric increase in payroll.
However, Joseph Sirosh, a Microsoft Corp. corporate vice president of information management and machine learning, believes AI—and more specifically, machine learning—will be essential to helping companies conduct business processes in which there simply are not enough people to do them in the first place. Many of those processes handle enormous and continuous volumes of digital data.
A great example of this is the way big companies defend their computer systems against attacks—hackers trying to penetrate their networks, malware that intrudes their email systems and web browsers, and more. “Every one of those things today are most efficiently detected in real-time and automatically, using machine learning algorithms,” he explains. “It is absolutely true that today’s machine learning algorithms are what is keeping Microsoft’s cyber infrastructure data secure. There are not a lot of human beings [at Microsoft] poking around trying to find out if there is something bad going on. It just would not scale.”
Without automated machine learning models to detect cyber-attacks, Microsoft and other big companies would have a hard time fending them off rapidly before damage is done, he notes. “Without these kind of automated systems, it would be very, very hard for these things to be detected fast enough to stop them,” he says. “When people launch a virus in some part of the world that is starting to spread over networks and infect PCs, when you look at the data coming from these machines, you can understand what is going on—if there is a machine learning algorithm going on behind the scenes alerting you to the dramatic changes that are happening.”
Guarding its computer networks is by no means the only place Microsoft has been applying its large and growing expertise in machine learning technology. Sirosh and others have been hired at Microsoft for several years to inject more machine learning models into the products and services that Microsoft sells. Products such as the Bing search engine and Microsoft’s entry into the digital assistant market (Cortana) are imbued with the machine learning’s ability to help a computer system become ‘smarter’ on its own, without the need for human programmers.
Take Bing, a search engine that in 2009 was a distant third in the marketplace to Google and Yahoo, according to market tracker ComScore. Back then, Microsoft had brought in a data scientist (Qi Lu, now a Microsoft EVP) who recommended the firm’s search engineers to build machine learning algorithms that would automatically and continuously refine Bing’s ability to summon relevant content. And he also suggested Microsoft build a data storage platform that stored all its search data, a critical piece for machine learning.
The Bing engineers followed his advice, and great things happened. By producing ever more relevant search results for Bing users, between 2009 and 2015 Bing’s share of the search market more than doubled to 20%. What is more, Microsoft’s search business has grown to more than $1 billion a quarter in revenue and has become profitable.
“The quality of the ranking results that are produced by the Bing search engine depends entirely on the machine learning models behind it,” Sirosh explains. “The machine learning models examine the search queries and what people click on. They then build a very powerful model that is then deployed in a few programmable data for extremely fast querying.”
The result is that every search result you get from typing words into Bing is found and ranked by a machine-learning model. “They’re producing huge amounts of quality improvements for our search customers,” says Sirosh. “That is one example where machine learning is totally built in the fabric of the product and has become one of its biggest differentiators.”
This is one of numerous ways that Microsoft has embedded machine learning into its technology products and services. It has a strategy that is central to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s initiative to continue to grow the 41-year-old company far beyond the personal computer. As a Bloomberg Businessweek article put it earlier this year, Nadella “has been sprinkling machine learning like fairy dust on everything his company touches.”1 Sirosh and many others at Microsoft are there to make that happen.

14,"Today’s most over-used corporate cliché is ‘disruption.’ See if the following sounds familiar to you from any number of business and technology publications you’ve likely read recently: “The world is changing, and we need to change with it—as a key part of our strategy, we are going to disrupt the [enter your favorite industry name here] market …”
But when it comes to customer experience (CX), the most effective path to major improvements is not necessarily accomplished through seismic shifts or dramatic innovations—the next Alexa or Uber. Instead, companies can often make major gains by creating a culture of continual improvement—a constant tweaking of systems and processes. These tweaks happen when they continually identify, prioritize, and address distinct pain points along the customer journey and lifecycle.
This article will describe how to implement an incremental and iterative approach to CX design and execution. We will demonstrate how numerous small improvements can roll up to create significant value and yield impressive ROI.
Going for Broke
In recent years, many companies have invested enormous amounts of money in CX initiatives. For example, the CEO of cruise line operator Carnival Corp. said that his firm has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technology that promises to transform the experience of its passengers.1 Walt Disney World poured an estimated $1 billion into a CX initiative in the hope that RFID-enabled wristbands would change the way visitors do everything, from entering their hotel rooms to riding the Space Mountain.2 Discount retailer Target Corp. announced it would spend $7 billion on a multiyear plan to revamp both the digital and in-store shopping experience to adapt to rapidly evolving guest preferences.3
These massive CX investments have prompted other companies to follow suit. Globally, CX spending is expected to reach $6.6 billion in 2017—nearly three times the amount spent in 2012. In five years, CX spending could double again, to $13.2 billion, as CX becomes the most important priority of many companies.4
Clearly, executives recognize the importance of CX to their businesses’ present and future viability. Companies invest in CX (and prioritize CX improvements) because they’ve seen evidence that CX matters. Research firm Forrester has shown that CX leaders had six times greater revenue growth than CX laggards from 2010 to 2015.5 And between 2007 and 2014, companies that excelled at CX achieved nearly four times the total stock market returns of competitors with poor CX.6

Why Small Changes Can Go Far
There’s no doubt that large investments to improve the customer experience can yield positive ROI. But does one need to throw billions, or even hundreds of million, of dollars at CX to move the needle?
Not necessarily. We believe companies can achieve major improvements in CX from targeted investments in just a few customer touch points. For instance, by some estimates, Amazon has generated billions of dollars in revenue simply by taking the friction out of online shopping via its patented 1-click ordering process. Zappos, by putting a free return label on its deliveries and implementing a 365-day return policy, won the loyalty of high-end shoe shoppers looking for an easier and less risky way to splurge on fancy footwear. In fact, the company has said that customers who sent back half their purchases buy more of its products.7 Nordstrom has begun putting kiosks outside store entrances so that online shoppers can pick up items without having to find a parking spot in mall lots and garages—a low-tech facilitator for the high-tech, omni-channel CX. Nordstrom considers this critical as 22% of its total sales now come through the online channel.8
Finding Small CX Improvements with Big Returns
We use a two-step mapping process to help companies identify lower-cost CX opportunities with outsized ROI:
1. Map the customer’s journey in detail—what it is today vs. what it needs to be tomorrow.
When customers contemplate a purchase, they embark on a journey: They evaluate their needs, explore which companies can solve those needs, make a purchase decision, take possession of the product, and begin using it.
Any customer journey can be segmented into dozens or even hundreds of micro-steps. The challenge is to step into the shoes of customers and walk the journey, mapping out the details across the customer lifecycle (awareness, research, selection, purchase, usage, and maintenance) that hopefully lead to repeat purchases.
Once you map out such a journey in as much detail as possible, the next step is to look for ways to improve each step the customer takes. What improvements can make the journey easier, faster, or more pleasant, without causing major organizational disruption for the company? For example, minor improvements in the usability of a smartphone app could improve CX in ways that yield significant ROI. According to research from Forrester and the National Retail Federation (NRF), smartphones are driving retail sales more than ever.
“Retailers have found that even modest investments in mobile initiatives can result in huge returns,” 
 says Artemis Barry, VP of digital retail at NRF.9

Figure 3: The TCS Customer Enterprise Framework
2. Map your own capabilities—what they are today vs. what they need to be tomorrow.
Having mapped your customer’s current journey and pinpointed changes that could yield significant improvements, your next step is to match those changes to your organization’s capabilities.
A customer enterprise framework, as shown in Figure 3, can be a valuable tool to determine which skills, business processes, systems, and technology infrastructure need improvements.
Consider, for example, the case of a large internet/cable/phone company that had to improve the customer experience provided by its contact centers. Its average care times were much longer than the industry average, leading to customer frustration and significantly increased operating costs. Further investigation identified the root of the problem: outdated technology coupled with inefficient processes. Customers were handed off from one representative to another, while the reps themselves struggled to cope with more than a dozen disparate IT systems. By adding a bit more automation to the front-end process, feeding web leads into a CRM workflow, and improving the IT interface (allowing the call center reps to see information from multiple systems at once), the company decreased handling time. These relatively minor and focused improvements had a big impact on CX. And they were the tip of the iceberg in the company’s CX initiative.
Only an Excellent CX Can Retain Fickle Customers
The CX stakes have never been higher than they are today. The ease of digital interactions and rising expectations for instant attention and service have made customers increasingly willing to shift their spending to a competitor even after just one negative experience.
Indeed, in 2016, Forrester found 40% of consumers have a high willingness and ability to shift their spending to another company, and another 25% of consumers building that mindset.10
In this environment, companies must continuously look to improve the end-to-end customer experience—not tomorrow, with massive initiatives that may take years to implement, but right now. But companies trying to implement a culture of continuous CX improvement should also expect internal pushback. The biggest barriers to achieving better CX are often cultural rather than technological.
The cable operator’s contact center had long been synonymous with personalized, high-touch service. Although research showed that customers now prefer faster, more efficient and automated interactions, the head of the customer care center worried that efficiency and automation would cost some of his employees their jobs. He did not recognize that in an era where cable companies must compete with a growing array of new competitors like Netflix and Hulu, the bigger risk was that dissatisfied customers would simply take their business elsewhere, potentially endangering the jobs of all the cable company’s employees.
Cultural pushback can masquerade as financial prudence (i.e., “We’d love to improve CX, but we just don’t have
the money now”). Such objections do not hold water. There are ways to make CX better within any budget.
If money is tight, the best thing is to start small, but make sure that those narrow changes will have the biggest possible impact.
In this way, you can demonstrate the value of CX improvements and secure funding for additional incremental improvements that will roll up into a big step forward.

15,"1. How has the retail industry’s idea of superior customer service changed recently?
The retail industry is in the midst of a tectonic change, and the lines between the digital, and physical shopper experience are blurring. Possessing powerful technologies at their fingertips, customers expect retailers to meet their needs, and wants at will, leading to ‘anytime, anywhere’ commerce. Additionally, customers want a frictionless shopping experience.
This is forcing retailers to make major changes in the customer experience. The story of Katie, a busy mom, illustrates this well.

While Katie’s shopping journey is ideal and simple, the grocery store’s responsibility to deliver such frictionless and superior customer service is not at all easy.
In this example, customer service is about delivering a seamless experience—the right items present at the right store, and the right recommendations being made, and offered at the right price. Additionally, parts of the retail supply chain—the inventory availability, time of pickup and the last mile fulfillment—are now more visible to the consumer and not hidden behind the scenes. What is more, store personnel play a more important role to ensure the last mile of the consumer’s process is hassle free.
All in all, the customer experience is becoming personalized, transparent, seamless, and real time.
2. What emerging technologies are most important to giving retailers a fuller, faster picture of customer likes and dislikes?
We first need to explain what fuller and faster means for consumers. Fuller means a seamless shopping experience irrespective of what channels customers use. But it also means knowing customers’ likes and dislikes throughout their shopping journey. Faster means instant gratification. That could mean filling an online order the same day, or even within a couple of hours.
With technologies, such as Internet of Things sensors and mobile devices, shopping becomes simpler for consumers, but more complicated for retailers. More consumers are using smartphones or IoT connected devices to place orders from their homes, and have merchants later deliver them. To achieve this, retailers face huge complexities. Their supply chain network has to choose the closest source for each item, while keeping customer preferences in mind. Retailers must also make sure they deliver according to customer expectations and replenish inventory for the next customer.
With the advent of smart robotics, retailers can now program human-like intelligence and learning capabilities into mobile robots, delivery drones, and other machines. That can free up store associates to spend more time on the floor—serving customers—and less time in the back room. Big data, cloud, AI, and social media tools also help retailers deliver truly exceptional customer experiences.
Looking ahead, Internet of Things, smart machines, intelligent automation and real-time data technologies will be crucial for retailers trying to transform this fuller and faster vision into a reality.
3. What is the next frontier for retailers in delighting customers?
It boils down to this—extreme personalization at every interaction point. Having a 360 degree view of the customer and using it across the retail value chain will be a key differentiator for retailers. Personalization could mean getting the assortments, pricing decisions, product recommendations, and customized loyalty programs right for every single customer. It could even include designing the customer experience and offering appropriate solutions based on the customer’s current context. Delivering extreme one-on-one personalization will be the next frontier in delighting and delivering truly exceptional customer experience and service. Retailers that can deliver extreme personalization at every point of the customer journey will be the true winners in this digital age.
Doing so will also require retailers to involve customers in the design of products and the in-store experience. Design thinking will play a key role here.
4. How important will personalization be to retailers?
Personalization will be crucial. A century ago, when mom-and-pop stores dominated, the store owner knew your name and preferences. He often knew even your anniversary or birthdays. It was an extremely personal relationship. With the rise of mass merchants, warehouse clubs and huge supermarket chains in the last 30 years, personalization moved to the store level but not the individual consumer level. Somewhere in the shift to large-format retailing, we lost the personal touch of the old mom-and-pop store.
Now, we are getting it back. With Big data and advanced analytics technologies, it is possible to establish the same kind of one-to-one personalization. A leading U.S. retailer developed what it believes is one of the world’s largest customer intelligence systems. The platform gives it a 360-degree view of customers. This retailer is beginning to use the insights from that system to personalize every point of interaction with their customers.

16,"Companies around the world have spent a ton of money on customer relationship management (CRM) systems—more than $26 billion annually.1 Yet many are still awaiting a financial return from their investments. This is especially true in B2B companies, many of which have told us that a sales force with more data is not necessarily a sales force that generates more revenue, closes more deals, and wins more repeat business. However, we also know of B2B firms that have generated robust returns from their CRM investments. In these companies, salespeople and sales managers can’t ever imagine life without a CRM system.
So what are B2B companies that are struggling to get value from CRM doing wrong? From our experience, their sales functions continue to live by seven principles, each of which has become a myth. I’ll go through each one and explain why they have become problematic. Then I’ll discuss the new beliefs that should replace the myths.
Myth No. 1: We Have a Long Time to Sell
This now-obsolete notion is that the B2B sales cycle is long, and thus a sales person has weeks or months to close a deal after an inquiry comes in. While research suggests the B2B purchasing process remains long, the sales process has shortened. The average B2B buyer is nearly 60% of the way through his buying process before he talks to a single vendor, according to CEB.2 You have less time to make a positive impression than you did before because by the time a buyer is ready to look at vendors, he has done most of his homework. It’s a reason why 70% of B2B buyers rated timeliness of a vendor’s response to their inquiries as a key reason for choosing the winning vendor.3
This means your sales force must know precisely what matters to your customers’ decision-makers and tailor the information to their needs. B2B buyers today say the most influential part of suppliers’ websites is ‘relevant content that speaks directly’ to their company.4 If you haven’t created a wellspring of such educational content in advance, you’re at a distinct disadvantage to the competitor that has it.
But it’s not just about content. It’s also about serving that content in the channels your customer uses to engage with your organization—website, secure portals, contact centers, even social media. Your sales and service representatives not only need this content, they need relevant data on the customer from which they can draw insights. And increasingly your people need artificial intelligence to recommend the next steps they should take with customers. Your website, too, should make those recommendations to customers based on how they interact with your site.
Myth No. 2: Most Times, Best Price Wins the Business
This myth is especially prevalent in commodity businesses. To be sure, in many B2B sectors being price competitive is still important. But other factors come into play, including tailoring commodity offerings to customers’ unique needs and providing trustworthy advice on how to get more value from them.
The latest research by Salesforce.com found that nearly four out of five B2B buyers greatly value salespeople who can be trusted advisers.5 It’s because the stakes in many B2B purchases—a large investment, a career, and competitive advantage—are rising. Salespeople who help buyers think through their needs and reduce those risks stand out.
An average of 5.4 people are involved in B2B purchases, according to CEB. The biggest challenge for companies making a purchasing decision is getting their decision-makers to agree on the problem and the right way to solve it—both of which happen before they choose a supplier.6 The most successful B2B suppliers help decision-makers reframe their problem and approach to solving it.
But becoming such a trusted adviser isn’t easy. It requires a supplier to liberally share customer information and insights internally—what Division 1, Division 2, Division 3, and so on know about the same customer. In many companies, phenomenal amounts of information on any single customer exist in divisions, product units, geographies, and functions. But few can easily bring this information together because their systems don’t share data and aren’t connected.
Myth No. 3: A Strong Brand Overcomes Ineffective Sales Processes
Wrong again. I’m not saying that a strong B2B brand is of little value. It can get you in the door and on the shortlist. But if you don’t react to new sales opportunities well enough and fast enough, your company’s familiar logo won’t help much.
Companies like LinkedIn and Paychex prove that B2B companies can come out of nowhere and gain share with a superior offering and competent sales processes but little advertising. Highly competent sales forces are critical to success.
McKinsey has found that firms with strong capabilities in qualifying and pursuing leads—presales work—have win rates of 40% to 50% of new deals and 80% to 90% with repeat business.7 Using modern sales practices and enabling technologies, sales forces can anticipate and eventually predict customer needs.
Myth No. 4: B2B Customers Don’t Buy on Emotion (Thus They Don’t Need a Compelling Sales Experience)
This is no longer true, if it ever was. While B2B buyers expect vendors to provide good educational information online long before they sign a purchase order, it takes only one piece of bad information about a vendor to sour a relationship.
There’s a lot riding today for B2B companies on multimillion-dollar purchases. Emotion plays a bigger role in the decision. A survey by Google and CEB of 3,000 buyers of products and services from 36 B2B brands found B2B customers were “significantly more emotionally connected to their vendors” than consumers were to the brands they purchased.
It’s up to sales people to deal with the emotional component of the customer’s purchase decision. Giving sales and service representatives insights into customer motivations allows them to tailor their interactions to those motivations.
It is also important to not forget the basics of great sales training and management. In the end, selling remains a people business. Sales representatives who can tailor your message and help buyers understand how your solution solves their problem are fundamentals that must not be lost in this age of technology.
Myth No. 5: Current Customers Will Give You More Slack in How Fast You Respond
Many loyal customers aren’t as patient as they used to be, and for good reasons: regulatory, political, and competitive. Customers are often working against fixed time frames, targets, or business objectives against which they will be measured. We know of telecommunications equipment manufacturers that must respond to leads from telcos much faster than in the past. The reason is telco purchasing cycles have accelerated due to exploding demands for digital data that courses through their networks.
Taking six months to configure the equipment increasingly won’t satisfy such customers. Streamlining the quote-to-cash process in your organization and giving sales and service representatives the right tools allows them to respond faster. Applied across channels, those same tools can even allow customers to serve themselves to your offerings, reducing time and resource constraints.
One telecommunications equipment manufacturer now lets customers configure and submit orders through a web portal or by talking to a contact center representative. That’s shaved weeks off the old sales process.
The results (in increased sales) have been phenomenal.
Myth No. 6: B2B Sales are Sequential and Should Focus on Providing Customers with Information
Lots of companies are spending heavily on educational material that explains their products and services, and how customers should use them. But many B2B buyers still have much to sort out after they’ve read such vendor content. It is up to sales people to further educate customers.
Sales people with exceptional educational skills remain highly valued. Forrester predicts 1 million of the worlds 4.5 million B2B sales jobs will disappear by 2020, supplanted by technology. Out of the four seller archetypes, ‘order takers’ (sales people who sell non-complex offerings in non-complex buying situations) would be eliminated by self-service online portals. However, ‘consultants’ (sales people selling complex offerings in complex buying situations) would thrive because they can make comprehensible abstract concepts and build relationships.8
Technology can help a sales force make a consultative sell. A global information services company created an online community for entrepreneurs and business owners to make connections with others like them at similar stages of development. It also helped them procure the services they needed, and used gamification to measure participation and contributions to the communities. The net result was that the vendor’s brand shifted from merely being an information provider to one that assembled a community of experts.
Myth No. 7: B2B Customers Don’t Want a Multichannel Selling Experience
Not true anymore. They not only need extremely knowledgeable sales people, they need highly informative websites, webinars, seminars, mobile apps, and other channels that help them make better decisions.
With so many channels for a B2B sales force to use now, how can it create a sales experience in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts? A good way to start is through a high-level customer segmentation via ‘personas’. Lay out the customer journeys for a maximum of five personas (e.g., repeat vs. new customers; infrequent vs. frequent purchasers, etc.). Then identify what information your firm possesses that would improve how sales people interact with each persona in each step of their buying journey and in each sales channel.
But don’t fall into the trap of only focusing on the customer journey and not on the supporting processes. If a customer places an order, you still need to fill it. You must link your customer-facing efforts to your back-end processes and systems. If you don’t, you’ll create an initial positive sentiment on the front end, but obliterate it when your firm doesn’t fill orders correctly or on-time on the back end, or if you provide poor service.
Many B2B sales forces continue to live by one or more of these seven myths. Those that have replaced them with truly customer-centric sales and marketing strategies have been gaining share. They are far better clued in to what their customers need, can respond much faster, and are superior at predicting what customers will need next.

17,"Digital technology lets companies tailor their interactions to customers’ specific needs and wants. Companies with such personalization capabilities can create a formidable competitive advantage. Consequently, personalizing the customer experience has become a new battlefield for companies.
Forrester called it one of the “critical success factors for winning in the age of the customer,” noting that customers will reward companies that anticipate their individual need, and punish those that do not.1 Accordingly, leading companies are adopting new technological capabilities and processes to customize the customer experience across various channels, throughout the customer lifecycle.
Digital leaders like Amazon have effective recommendation engines that not only increase their share of the customer’s customers, but also make their lives easier. Netflix sends its Internet television subscribers personalized suggestions based on their viewing habits and has decreased customer churn by several percentage points. The Netflix personalization strategy has increased the lifetime value of an existing Netflix subscriber while reducing the number of new customers the company must acquire to achieve its revenue targets. Personalization is worth more than $1 billion a year for Netflix.2
The question of personalization as a competitive imperative is no longer in question. The new question is how to meet the customer’s expectations for intimacy while still respecting privacy norms and boundaries. In other words, companies must figure out how to tune into customers without turning them off.
Customers will reward companies that anticipate their individual need and punish those that do not.
According to a survey of 3,000 adults around the world, more than half of consumers (57%) expect the brands they do business with to understand their needs and preferences.3 However, there are boundaries that firms need to monitor and understand:
• Roughly three-quarters of consumers said companies that used their personal data without their permission were violating their privacy.
• Nearly three-quarters of consumers say online ads that use information gleaned from their online behaviors and activities make them uneasy, with half of them saying such experiences make them feel “creeped out,” according to a 2016 CEB/Gartner survey.4
• Yet only 2% of corporate marketing professionals that CEB/Gartner surveyed felt their personalized marketing communications offended customers. That is a significant disconnect that all companies should address.
Generally, customers are more willing to share personal data that enables personalization if they trust the company requesting it to keep their information secure, and if they feel that the company is giving them something they value in return for their information. But why does one company’s attempt to provide that value keep customers coming back for more while another’s attempt winds up creeping customers out and driving them away? Many companies struggle to answer that question.

The Seven Deadly Sins of Personalization
Based on our experience across numerous industries and clients, TCS has identified seven common personalization mistakes that companies make while interacting with their customers in one-on-one situations. Figure 1 below showcases the Seven Deadly Personalization Sins.
                                                         
 
Figure 1: Seven Deadly Personalization Sins
1. Breaking Bonds. Sharing or selling personal information without the customer’s clear understanding (for example, by requiring customers to opt-in to have their data collected or shared). Just a handful of industries in the U.S. (such as healthcare) have regulations regarding how customer information must be handled. Most companies are not required to notify customers about the ways in which they may use their personal data. In fact, the U.S. Congress recently repealed online privacy protections that would have prevented internet providers from selling customer data, including their Web browsing histories, without permission.5 But just because companies can dig into and distribute their customers’ personal data without their knowledge does not mean they should.
2. Digging Too Deep. Correlating personal or behavioral data (for example, email or cross-website browsing data) outside of the direct interactions between the company and its customers for personalized purposes can make customers feel spied upon. This often happens when someone searches for information on a website (say, looking for a car) and is then served car ads when visiting a clothing site.
3. Helicoptering. Companies increasingly offer real-time personalization based on the customer’s location and prior purchases. But this can come back to haunt that company. Imagine the luxury store dressing room attendant who knows your name as you approach her. Would you feel comfortable about trying on clothes in the back room and leaving them all behind if they were too tight this time? We doubt it.
4. Overcrowding. High volumes of personalized marketing from multiple groups within a company can make customers feel bombarded and even harassed. For example, a customer buys a toaster, and suddenly his inbox is full of kitchen appliance and kitchen renovation pitches.
5. Category Jumping. Conjoining multiple topics with minimal linkages annoys customers. A car dealer’s following up on a customer’s purchase of car mats with an offer for a bike rack (because of the customer’s recent purchase of a bicycle) is creepy for the customer. He wonders how the car dealer made that logical leap. Another example of category jumping is the customer who purchases diet soda and then begins receiving advertisements for weight-loss products.
6. Boudoir Topics. Exploiting potentially sensitive situations (e.g., purchase of pregnancy tests) to deliver personalized discounts (e.g., baby products) may alienate customers. Some offers are best left to multi-product efforts that target personal needs with a broader basket of goods. The customer is influenced by such marketing while not feeling specifically targeted.
7. Moral Hazards. These are the practices that cover a range of tactics that are technically legal but would reflect poorly on the company if exposed. “What would your mother think?” is a question marketers should ask themselves. If you think mom would disapprove, eschew these practices.
Handling Customization with Care
Understanding and respecting the boundaries of acceptable customer experience personalization is a critical first step. Each company must create its own approach, one that lays out the values, strategy, execution methods, and governance it needs to be effective without being creepy. Figure 2 below captures the factors governing personalization.
Values
Before making any technology investment or strategy decision, an organization must decide where it sits on the customer personalization spectrum. An organization’s culture and the nature of its customer relationships should guide its personalization values. More conservative firms, or those that depend upon high levels of customer trust (such as financial services and healthcare), may take a more restrained approach to mining customer data for personalization. Retailers or social media companies, on the other hand, may better be able to push the envelope without encountering customer resistance.
This is the stage where an enterprise should decide what might be a boudoir topic for its customers, or what those customers might consider a betrayal of trust. Companies seeking to capitalize on personalization must clearly define the limits of their marketing practices, and communicate them broadly throughout the organization.

Figure 2: Governing Personalization
Strategy
The next step in outlining the desired business outcomes of personalization is defining the strategies. Is the purpose of its customer interactions to provide better post-sale customer service, increase conversion rates, or reduce marketing costs through effective targeting?
Companies must also decide which channels will benefit from personalization efforts, and which channels will not. Companies that benefit from personalization based on potentially sensitive customer data may limit that personalization to more private channels like email vs. SMS messages in a retail environment.
Companies must base their personalization strategies on their values. They must broadly share their values and enforce them in all business units and customer-facing functions. The largest hurdle is translating those values into tactical directions so that marketing, sales, and customer service groups avoid issues such as ‘helicoptering’ or ‘overcrowding’. To ensure that everyone plays by the rules, the strategy must coordinate actions across functions and business units.
Execution
In executing their personalization strategies, companies must make oversight and govern top priorities. A big challenge for them is balancing the need to remain true to their customer values while letting marketing experiment with the latest digital marketing technologies and personalization approaches. This requires experimentation guidelines that balance the need to improve marketing efficiency and effectiveness with the need to respect customer privacy.

Infrastructure
An organization’s data infrastructure—the customer data it collects and the ways in which it analyzes and uses that data—is a key source of competitive advantage. But data usage techniques can also create customer dissatisfaction and defection if not properly governed. Controlling access to personalization data is the best way to avoid such risks. Organizations that appoint owners of customer data and put in place robust data oversight and governance are less likely to cross their own boundaries and avoid ‘overcrowding’.
The Personalization Journey
To become highly effective at personalizing their customer experiences, companies must learn to walk before they can run. Amazon’s recommendation engine, for example, was years in the making. An advanced personalization approach that is accurate and appreciated by customers takes time to develop.
TCS Personalized Data Maturity Models (For Sales and Service Operations)

Figure 3: How Mature is Your Personalization Model?
In terms of the maturity of their personalization models, we categorize a company’s personalization maturity with Emerging, Practicing, and Leading rankings based on customer contact frequency, use of customer data, target offers, and personalized messaging, as shown in Figure 3.
Emerging companies have a basic customer data usage strategy and base their personalization efforts on fundamental customer data. However, they have limited values to guide execution, which therefore delivers varying results. At the other end of the spectrum, leading companies have clearly defined data use policies, coordinated enterprise personalization efforts, and explicit guidance on how to interact with customers based on data.
Companies at all three stages—Emerging, Practicing, and Leading—must balance the opportunities and risks of their personalization efforts. With the power to personalize comes responsibility. In fact, the more advanced the personalization approach, the more important it is for an organization to stay within the seven boundaries. As Voltaire said, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

18,"The relentless spread of mobile apps now offers companies an unimagined degree of access and connection to their customers. But the flood of companies looking to seize this opportunity has given rise to a new challenge: In this intensely competitive space, how can you ensure that potential and existing customers will download and use your company’s apps?
This is (among other things) a design challenge, with serious business consequences. As the power of mobile apps to create competitive differentiation and advantage grows across industries and geographies, fielding compelling apps is becoming ever more important. To win market share in the mobile world, companies must develop and deliver apps whose quality, usability, and functionality make them irresistible to demanding customers.
More is Riding on Useful Apps
“Mobile is the future,” predicted Google’s then-CEO Eric Schmidt in 2010. Schmidt’s prediction came true fast. In 2016, 77% of Americans owned a smartphone, more than double the percentage in 2011.1

The use of mobile apps followed in lockstep with the explosion in mobile device ownership. An estimated 150 billion mobile apps were downloaded in 2016.2 That same year, the average American spent nearly 49 hours a month using mobile apps, and one in seven of their app sessions lasted longer than 10 minutes.3

The rising use of apps means they increasingly define how consumers and businesses buy products and services, access information, troubleshoot their purchases, play games and consume entertainment, and interact with others. This has resulted in a windfall for companies that excel at app development.
“Mobile is the future.”
Witness Starbucks. As of Q1 2016, customers had downloaded Starbucks’ mobile order-and-pay app 11 million times. In that quarter alone, orders placed through the app generated an estimated 21% of the coffee house chain’s U.S. store transactions. 4 No wonder then-CEO (now executive chairman) Howard Schultz proclaimed, “Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability, and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers.”
Unfortunately, when it comes to mobile apps, companies like Starbucks are an exception. Many companies are not getting full value from their apps. A recent study revealed that 75% of users fail to return to newly downloaded apps the next day, while average app retention rates fall to just 4% after 90 days.5
Howard Schultz proclaimed, “Technology innovation is further strengthening our brand, improving our efficiency and in-store execution, increasing our profitability, and most importantly, enabling us to deliver an elevated Starbucks experience to our customers.”
The deficiencies of many apps are also evident in sales conversion rates on e-commerce sites. In 2016, Adobe reported that only 16% of shopping carts on smartphone apps converted to orders compared with 26% for shopping carts on desktop computers. “Simply having an app doesn’t cut it,” concluded the report’s authors. “The app graveyard is getting larger due to abandonment and lack of mobile optimization.”6
There are three primary reasons why apps end up in the graveyard:

A disappointing experience: Many apps simply do not provide a great (or even a good) customer experience. A 2015 ARC research study of U.S. travel apps found that four of the largest airlines were rated among the bottom eight apps in the industry because of quality shortcomings.7
A flawed business case: Other apps are launched in the wrong place at the wrong time. London-based Hailo launched its yellow-cab ride hailing app in New York City just as Uber was achieving scale in that market. The Uber juggernaut sank the new service.8
 An overly complex design: Still other apps are too ambitious, coming to market hobbled by a crippling load of complexity.

The mobile app challenge is further exacerbated because customer expectations are continually raising the design bar, particularly relating to the user experience. “These mobile moments are the next battleground where companies will win, serve, and retain their customers,” explains Forrester Research Vice President Judy Ask. “Tragically, few companies will make the leap. Those that do will reap the rewards.”9
Three Design Precepts for Upping Your App Game
Your company can reap the rewards of mobile apps if you keep three design precepts in mind:

 Understand that companies like Starbucks, Uber, and Facebook are determining your customers’ expectations for the mobile app experience, even if you’re selling process control equipment to oil refineries.
 While the technological capabilities that power your apps should become even more sophisticated, they must always deliver an even simpler, more seamless user experience.
 Your apps must be able to learn your customers’ preferences and behaviors, and use that knowledge to personalize their experience via a continuous and virtuous feedback loop.

 
1. Customer expectations start with the best B2C apps
Users expect all apps to perform as well as those created by the leading consumer app developers. That means your app will not be measured against your direct competitors’ apps, but against the experience provided by companies like Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube.
2. Use emerging technologies to simplify the customer experience, while increasing functionality
Companies can use a variety of new, emerging technologies to create apps that learn from their users and automatically adjust to their needs. For instance, when a customer only uses a banking app for transferring money between accounts, an app can streamline and simplify the user experience by taking the customer directly to that function while hiding or minimizing others.
Voice technology is rapidly rising on the list of customer app expectations because of offerings like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Echo, and Google Voice. Voice integration and recognition is beginning to simplify the ordering process, thereby removing the friction that causes consumers to abandon shopping carts at checkout.
Bots driven by AI promise to become central to app-mediated customer engagements. As bots become more sophisticated, they will be able to answer customer questions, resolve their problems, and complete their orders more efficiently and cost-effectively than many customer service employees.
Computer vision—which can process, analyze, and understand digital images, producing algorithms to drive decision-making—is also adding new dimensions to the app experience in a wide variety of applications. For example, Microsoft is collaborating with appliance company Liebherr to develop a refrigerator that recognizes the food on its shelves, communicates with the owner’s smartphone, and creates a shopping list in the app based on what the refrigerator sees.10
Predictive analytics enables apps to anticipate user behaviors and act accordingly, in many cases, utilizing wireless sensors, big data, and analytics technologies. Nest thermostat apps, for example, sense when you arrive home and change the temperature based on your preferences, and then change it again after you leave.
All these technologies will further elevate the role of smartphones in your customers’ lives. And as your customers do more and more business within the mobile universe, your company’s apps will need to be as smart as their phones, which leads to our final design precept.
3. Design apps that learn users’ preferences and behaviors, and continually personalize the experience.
In 2007, Apple rejected a Blackberry-like keyboard with physical buttons in favor of a software-based keyboard. As a result, Apple has been able to improve its keyboard’s functionality iteratively, continually delivering new functionalities remotely to its customers. The lesson for app designers: Don’t hard-code the user experience into your app.
Companies encounter this lesson in one of the first decisions they face when designing an app: Should it be native to a single operating system (OS) or a hybrid that works across systems and devices?
App designers quickly learned that each mobile operating system comes with its own capabilities and limitations, and responded with a hybrid approach that enabled the development of apps for many devices and operating systems. This ability led some companies to make the native-or-hybrid decision too quickly, and with too little thought. Often, these companies simply followed the lead of other companies that had developed similar apps. But the correct answer for your company depends on the specific requirements of your app.
Going the native route can add significant cost and time to app development. It also increases the total cost of ownership, as maintaining several native apps for different operating systems is more expensive than maintaining a single hybrid app. However, for complex apps that require tapping the unique capabilities of a specific OS, a native app may be the right approach.
Hybrid apps can be developed faster than native apps, and thus at lower cost. But different operating systems have inherently different styles for swiping, scrolling, etc. As a result, an app designed to work on all of them inevitably will not perform as well as one designed to work with one. These variances in performance frustrate users. Moreover, hybrid apps typically cannot take full advantage of each OS’s unique capabilities.
Apps Are Where It’s At
With more business transacted via smartphones in both the B2C and B2B arenas, all companies need to think about how they can use mobile apps to serve their customers better, as well as enhance their apps’ performance and results. It takes time and investment to acquire the capabilities they will need to design apps that offer compelling experiences.
However, as mobile apps become an increasingly important competitive and brand differentiator, companies that rise to the challenge of designing them to ‘stick’ with consumers will reap the rewards.

19,"The next battle in the customer experience wars will not be the fight to win sales but the struggle to dominate the after-sale. The key weapon in that war will be systems built around Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and wireless communications that will enable companies to track their products, services, and—in many cases—their customers, after the purchase has been completed. The goal is to continue adding value to a company’s product or service, thereby winning the customer’s loyalty, and setting the scene for future revenue streams throughout the customer lifecycle.
IoT technologies are advancing rapidly. Global IoT spending will grow at a compound rate of 15.6% through 2020 when it will become a $1.29 trillion market, according to a 2017 IDC report.1 IoT technologies are graduating from the experimentation phase and becoming central to business strategy. It is no longer a question of whether and when the technology will deliver value, but where they will have the greatest impact.
The post-sales experience, ripe for reinvention, will be one of those areas. For many products, the post-sale experience is the biggest driver of customer satisfaction—or dissatisfaction. Four out of 10 American consumers said their post-sale experience with a company was the most memorable aspect of the brand experience, and eight out of 10 said a positive post-purchase experience was important.2
For many products, the post-sale experience is the biggest driver of customer satisfaction—or dissatisfaction.
In addition to post-sales brand impact, new technologies will have a major impact on the costs of taking care of customers throughout the product lifecycle. Clearly, the opportunity is enormous for companies across industries, to embrace IoT systems to transform the post-sales experience. The IoT can provide companies with the ‘ultimate truth’ on product performance: how their offerings are performing in the hands of customers.3Companies that leverage IoT technologies to reveal those truths most effectively will win the customer experience wars.
Transforming the Post-Purchase World
IoT systems present companies with a wide range of opportunities to improve, or even reinvent, the post-sale experience for themselves and their customers—from increasing customer satisfaction to reducing costs to shortening response times. We have identified five key areas where IoT technologies can help transform this experience.
1. Getting ahead of pending product failures and service problems
One of the most obvious ways that IoT can improve the post-sale experience is using the technology to better understand how products are performing in the field. In doing so, companies can avoid frustrating, value-destroying equipment failures and costly service visits before they happen. This is especially important in high-tech and other industries where high-value assets are deployed.
Automated teller machine (ATM) maker Diebold Nixdorf Inc. has been using technology to diagnose and remotely repair its ATMs without having to dispatch a technician. This is a complete strategic transformation for the company, whose service processes were built around dispatching parts and labor whenever there was a problem with a machine.
Diebold Nixdorf can now solve 17% of ATM problems remotely, which has reduced ATM downtime by 15% and whittled the turnaround time to fix an ATM from three hours to less than 30 minutes.4
Coca-Cola Enterprise in Europe has been using sensors on its vending machines to track supplies and machine problems for several years,5 and GE Healthcare is Internet-connecting two million medical imaging machines worldwide, including 500,000 of its own.6
With IoT, companies from telecom equipment manufacturers to hardware vendors can monitor their devices for signs of impending problems, thereby reducing the number of customer repair visits, improving first-time fix metrics, and generally shortening the time-to-repair. Proactive maintenance, enabled by the IoT, is applicable in consumer electronics and other home goods, from hot water tanks to HDTVs, improving the customer experience and keeping companies in front of their customers after the sale. As the cost of IoT-enabled devices comes down, the scope will continue to increase.
2. Reducing the number and costs of returns
Reverse logistics are a major cost in retailing and other sectors. According to the National Retail Federation, 8% of consumer products sold by retailers in the U.S. are returned annually, accounting for $260 billion in merchandise.7 And while it may be relatively simple to return a product on the front end, the process is extremely complex and expensive on the back end. IoT technology capable of diagnosing or preventing product issues could reduce the likelihood of product returns and the associated costs of returns handling.
Customers might be less likely to return items if they are fixed quickly and remotely, benefiting the customer (who retrieves greater value from his or her purchase) and preserving retailer revenues while reducing post-sale return costs. Remotely diagnosing problematic products that are beyond the point of repair will save companies from paying to have them returned; customers instead can be asked to dispose of the products themselves.
3. Increasing value and convenience throughout the product lifecycle
There are many ways companies can use IoT technologies to help customers make better use of their products post-purchase, as well as experience less frustration with them. GE Aviation’s Predix software platform enables its customers to get better performance (and greater value) from the jet engines it sells them. HP has turned its products into IoT hubs in its customers’ homes. It fitted its printers with wireless sensors to monitor ink levels and trigger replacement cartridge orders before the customer runs out—providing both convenience and recurring revenue.8 Amazon has introduced an IoT button (based on its consumer Dash button for reordering products) which developers and programmers can use to access Amazon’s cloud to count or track items, order services (from TV programs to pizza), or provide feedback.9 One company has even introduced ‘Internet-connected’ prescription bottles that sense how many capsules are left inside, how often an individual is taking the pills, and how changes in prescription regimen affect test results.10
According to the National Retail Federation, 8% of consumer products sold by retailers in the U.S. are returned annually, accounting for $260 billion in merchandise.
4. Informing R&D
IoT sensors can be a valuable source of data to inform the development of new or improved products and services. By analyzing the ways in which customers use their products and services, companies can determine which features are most useful and which customers consider less valuable. Common sources of failure can be addressed in future designs, and the data retrieved from products can significantly shorten the design-test-build development cycle, helping companies bring new products and services to market more quickly, thereby gaining a march on their competitors.
5. Increasing sales opportunities
Data gathered from IoT-connected devices enable companies to evolve from reactive to proactive selling, and not just of post-purchase services such as ink cartridges. Companies can analyze the ongoing performance of the products they sell to customers for trends that might indicate other product needs. A network equipment manufacturer might notice customer usage patterns that are straining the customer’s existing infrastructure and use that data to sell the company more appropriate networking products to prevent future failures.
Applying IoT to the Post-Sales Experience
While there is clear value in implementing IoT infrastructure to improve the customer’s long-term product or service experience, many companies struggle with deciding where to start. There are five steps a company can take to identify and begin pursuing these opportunities.
1. Determine the best use cases
Before thinking about investment, companies should seek to understand which products or services would benefit most from IoT enablement. Expensive goods and services, or those with a greater incidence of service issues, are good targets. ‘Internet-connecting’ a product that consumers are likely to throw away if it fails, is wasted investment. In fact, TCS research found that 54% of companies were using sensors to monitor products valued at $1 million to $10 million while just 6% were doing so with products valued at $100 or less.11
2. Calculate the impact
Creating robust business cases can be time-consuming and difficult since IoT is still an emerging area. But companies can use existing data to create proxy business cases to get a good idea of the financial impact of IoT on their product or service prior to making a large investment.
3. Conduct a mini proof of concept
Begin by Internet-connecting one product or product line to make sure the technology works and is generating the benefits expected for the company and its customers. The outcome of this will help inform future business cases and validate the assumptions you make. Piggy backing on a new product release can be a good place to start rather than reverse engineering an existing product.
4. Make the case for customer data sharing
It’s important to make it clear what customers can expect in exchange for sharing data with the company. HP offered customers savings of up to 50% for participating in its initial IoT-enabled printer launch.
5. Create a robust IoT foundation
Companies ultimately must implement the infrastructure required to support IoT-enabled transformation of the post-purchase experience. For many companies, obtaining the infrastructure (and technical know-how) through ‘as-a-service’ model may be the best approach, at least in early stages, if not indefinitely. Ocean shipping company Maersk Lines, for example, has been using Ericsson’s cloud to host the real-time monitoring of its fleet since 2012.12
Companies must, however, build and manage their own product usage databases to handle the torrent of real-time data at a scale and speed never encountered before. In fact, they are very likely to need artificial intelligence systems to make sense of it all. For instance, in the months after launching its IoT-enabled Cat Connect service in 2014, heavy equipment maker Caterpillar was receiving a million terabytes of data a day from its equipment.13 The next year, the company invested in a big data predictive analytics company and, in 2016, it bought M2M, which creates hosted solutions for monitoring and managing assets remotely.14
The Ultimate Differentiator
Customer experience is becoming the ultimate competitive differentiator, and the post-sales period is rapidly emerging as the most critical aspect of that experience. Companies that want to continue to win in their markets need to act now to explore the opportunities IoT-related technologies are creating to transform the post purchase experience to help retain and build long lasting customer connections.

20,"It costs $600 billion per year to field the 270 billion calls made annually to the world’s customer contact centers.1 Many of these are already highly automated, using voice recognition and other technologies to expedite call routing and processing. But advances in digital technologies could help these centers deliver far better service to more customers at lower cost. Here is a look at ways in which companies can evolve their contact centers and increase customer loyalty and profitability.
From Call Centers to Contact Centers
Once upon a time, most people contacted customer service by telephone. Just 10 years ago, smartphones were in their infancy, social media was for kids, and it was rare for anyone to use email to contact a company to ask a question or file a complaint.
That world is vanishing. In 2015, digital contact (email, web chat, social media, and self-service channels) was on pace to overtake voice-based contact by this year. But these new capabilities don’t come cheaply. For many corporations, contact centers are a major expense. And while they have more potential than ever to maintain and increase customer loyalty, they also have become large and growing cost centers.
We believe that the best approach to modernizing a contact center is to do it in phases: automation, customer engagement, and transformation. Let’s look at each stage.
Three Stages for Upgrading the Contact Center

Which stage to begin requires asking a few critical questions. Three are elemental:

 How important is customer service to your company? Is it a non-critical component or a competitive differentiator?
 How complex is your product or service? A simple product may not need a lot of customer support, while a more complex product or service might demand plenty of high-touch handholding.
Do your customers depend on the continuous operation of your products or services for their own success, or are they willing to tolerate occasional interruptions and downtime? For example, a homeowner might be disappointed if a backyard barbecue grill fails to light in July, but be desperate if a home furnace malfunctions in January.

Once you answer those questions, you can go deeper into your three options for the contact center as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Three Stages for Evolving the Contact Center
1. Automation: For efficiency and lower costs
If you choose the automation approach, your goal should be to reduce customer volume in high-cost engagement channels such as phone calls, by shifting as much volume as possible to low-cost automated channels such as internet-based self-service knowledge banks and chat bots.
If your contact center is not automated, a first step would be to introduce basic automation elements such as Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems that allow callers to obtain answers to many common questions in a self-service system. On the back end, process automation can improve agent productivity by reducing the time it takes to solve common, simple problems. Meanwhile, descriptive analytics can pinpoint service problems to remove bottlenecks. One of the UK’s leading media and telecom businesses reduced costs $3 million a year merely by cutting down on handling times, resolving customer problems the first time, and reducing call transfers.
Consolidation goes together with automation. If you have multiple data centers, you can reduce your real estate costs by merging them into fewer, larger facilities. At the same time, systems consolidation combined with on-demand cloud resources can reduce hardware costs. Of course, if your contact center is not a competitive driver for your business, you might want to consider the financial and operational implications of outsourcing the function.
Such automation initiatives should be judged according to the metrics such as lower operational costs coupled with greater efficiency (e.g., higher call volume per agent, shorter average time to resolution, etc.).
Consider the case of Cell C, the third-largest GSM telecom service provider in South Africa. The company implemented a next-generation contact center solution using the Oracle Service Cloud. The new system centralized and streamlined the way Cell C provided customer service, enabling cross-channel reporting and establishing a robust knowledge management system. By automating key business processes—including prioritization and distribution of incoming customer inquiries—Cell C provided customers with a better experience, improved agent productivity, and reduced operating costs. Eventually, Cell C expects more customers will turn to the self-service knowledge base, which should limit growth in call center volume and keep costs contained.
2. Customer engagement: Happier agents, more loyal customers
For many companies, the contact center has become a competitive necessity, if not an advantage. In a 2016 global survey, 85% of contact center executives viewed customer experience as a means to differentiate their company. Half said they felt that contact centers play a primary role in customer retention.2 A recent Harvard Business Review article argued that the better the environment for contact center agents, the better the outcomes for customers.3 We agree: Customer satisfaction starts with satisfied contact center agents.
To boost agent satisfaction, we suggest

reinvesting the cost savings achieved through automation to streamline the systems that agents use (making their work easier),

provide them with new skills (adding valuable learning to the work environment). The goal should be to cultivate a culture of customer engagement across traditional and newer channels by training agents to use new digital channels (e.g., chat, social media, text messages, etc.) to solve customer problems and identify customer needs.


If you follow a customer engagement strategy, track success by customer churn rates and satisfaction scores, first-contact resolution percentages, abandon rates (the percentage of customers who hang up before agents can help them), and customer lifetime value. One way to measure whether agents are satisfied is by tracking turnover.
For example, a large automaker had an outdated contact center that could only handle voice calls. The automaker deployed new technology that enabled agents to provide multichannel support across email, phone, SMS, and chat. A knowledge management solution gave agents access to 14 internal and external information sources. Thanks to these optimizations and upgrades, the company achieved 25% faster complaint resolution and higher customer satisfaction scores. The new system also enabled managers to easily create reports that provided valuable customer insights.
3. Transformation: Predicting and preventing customer problems
Are the products your company sells, or the services it provides, vital to your customers’ operations?
That’s often the case for industrial companies selling high-ticket items (like aircraft engines) to business customers.
If this is your business, you might consider transforming your contact center into a profit center. By embedding Internet of Things (IoT) technology into your company’s products, you can gain access to a trove of data. With proper analysis, this data will give you a better understanding of the way that customers use your products and services.
IoT technology can also enable prescriptive analytics, allowing your contact center to move beyond responding to customer problems and to begin anticipating them. With remote diagnostics tools, agents can monitor equipment and reach out to customers to flag concerns, suggest improvement opportunities, or stop problems before they occur.
Instead of focusing first on your own business’ efficiency, a transformative contact center approach looks to make your customers’ operations more efficient, turning them into loyal brand advocates. As a transformative contact center initiative begins to succeed, you should see lower customer acquisition costs and higher transaction conversion rates. Average order values should increase. Ultimately, the primary measure of success will be whether the contact center drives revenue growth and profit.
It takes skilled agents to transform a contact center. They will need high-level customer management and analytical skills, along with a passion for solving problems. For example, contact center agents at a cable and phone service provider that monitors customer data usage for abnormal activity could reach out to alert customers if they might be experiencing a hacking attack.
In another sector, we’ve been working with a utility provider to prove the feasibility of having the contact center plugged into data from a connected home. If sensors indicate that a furnace has failed, or a hot water heater has sprung a leak, the agent could call to help the customer avoid a catastrophe.
Creating Contact Centers for a Complex World
Digital technology now occupies every corner of our lives, and as products and services incorporate digital technologies, they become more complex. Customers need more support to use these digitally enhanced products and services to their full potential. And now that those products can be interconnected, contact centers can be proactive, anticipating and preventing customer problems from occurring. That will turn such a contact center into a killer app for inspiring loyalty.
With the right technology and agent training, contact centers can help companies stand out, deliver memorable service, and attract new business.

21,"1. Do you expect the pace of M&A activity in the life science sector to pick up, slow down, or stay steady in the next five years?
Life sciences companies currently face strategic challenges including a softer sales pipeline, falling profit margins, and regulatory pressures. In the recent past, M&A activity has been driven by portfolio consolidation, cost optimization, market expansions, and tax inversions. However, for pharma and bio-tech companies, acquisitions of mainly European companies for the purpose of tax inversion will slow in coming years. M&A focus will shift to emphasize market expansion, pipeline expansion, margin improvements, and increasing product portfolios. For medical devices companies, the focus will be on access to new and emerging markets, acquiring new technologies, and acquiring vertical integration capabilities, such as the ability to add services onto products.
Look for a shift from mega deals to comparatively smaller transactions, where pharmaceutical companies acquire niche capabilities and focus on transformation. Large M&A activity will center around the U.S. and Western Europe along with other consolidation across the globe.
At the same time, the industry will also see divestitures, as companies shed their non-core assets which lack significant growth potential or synergies with core product or services. As these companies focus on consolidation and infusion of capital to their core businesses, they will strengthen their respective leadership positions, as we have already seen in some recent deals involving Novartis, GSK, Boehringer Ingelheim, and others.
2. How important is M&A expertise to the success of today’s life science companies?
Even with the increased focus on M&A in life sciences, some recent deals did not deliver the desired business outcome due to poor planning around integration. To meet business objectives, companies need to do comprehensive M&A due diligence, followed by careful change management to ensure well planned integration across the enterprise, including business processes and IT systems. It is critical that life sciences companies build their in-house capabilities where needed to manage these integration-related business activities more effectively.
3. What tactics do the smartest life sciences companies use to maximize the value of life science startups, after an acquisition?
These companies acquire a startup to gain access to IP, technology, and skills that help unlock new areas of business growth and expansion. This requires preserving and nurturing the startup, while providing added access to the marketplace, partner ecosystems, and company resources. At the same time, the acquirer must continuously evaluate and capitalize on the synergies with the start-up, with an eye to expanding its own products and services.
While traditional M&A approaches have focused on financial values and markets, talent is often the prize today. The people of the acquired business are themselves a key driver of the deal, representing significant business value. The acquired company’s leaders or teams have developed some specific ways of operating, solutions to problems that have been central to their success. Thus, M&As can be used to introduce fresh ideas and break an operational logjam in the larger organization.
4. How would you rate life science companies’ expertise in this area, as compared to other industries? From whom could they learn?
Some mature organizations in sectors such as technology and retail have streamlined the M&A integration process, adopting a set of best practices for operational playbooks, change management, and related matters. Within the life sciences industry, select large companies have been fairly successful with M&A deals. Still, considering the high level of deal volume expected in the life sciences sector, life science companies should focus on two lessons from mature companies in other sectors.
First, these companies should build a rigorous pre-deal due diligence process that identifies potential risks and complexities and informs deal decisions. Second, a repeatable integration process can help companies quickly take advantage of acquired capabilities and realize deal synergies. Additionally, life sciences companies should improve their capabilities around change management and the ability to assimilate team members from diverse organizational cultures.

22,"Digital ecosystems increasingly are coalescing around companies that offer consumers the products and services they need to accomplish major goals—for example, buying a home or car, taking a big vacation, or finding a new job. Companies that are knitting these ecosystems together—think TripAdvisor in travel or TrueCar.com in purchasing autos—will begin setting the standard in the digital experience that customers have become accustomed to. As such, every company that wants to plug into these ecosystems will need to ensure that its piece of the digital experience is on par with those of other companies.
Consider the way consumers buy homes now. When many people look for a new home, they enter sprawling digital ecosystems filled with connected real estate companies, mortgage providers, insurance firms, home inspectors, lawyers, movers, and more. When they search for a new car, they find themselves in a digital ecosystem comprising dealers, insurers, motor vehicle registries, and even in-car entertainment systems sold by a variety of providers. And when they take a vacation, they dip into another digital ecosystem of hotels, restaurants, tour companies, entertainment venues, and so forth.
These digital ecosystems first began to emerge approximately 20 years ago, starting in travel (e.g., Expedia, Priceline, Travelocity) and automobiles (Cars.com), and later in sectors such as music (e.g., iTunes launched by Apple in 20031). A recent Gartner survey of more than 2,500 CIOs in 93 countries found that 79% of top performers participated in digital ecosystems compared with 49% of average performers and 24% of trailing companies.
Companies at the forefront of digitizing their businesses recognize that they must compete in digital ecosystems, which Gartner defines as groupings of “enterprises, competitors, customers, regulators, and other stakeholders that exchange information and interact electronically.”2
Consider a company like TripAdvisor, which has carved out an important niche in the $1.3 trillion global travel market. The company hosts some 465 million reviews on 7 million hotels, motels, restaurants, and tourist attractions. Visitors to TripAdvisor will find links to more than 200 websites where they can research and book hotels. TripAdvisor’s 390 million unique average monthly visitors have earned the company $1.5 billion in revenue and $120 million in net income in 2016.3
Naturally, TripAdvisor profits from the ecosystem it has built. But the company is only successful because its ecosystem partners are also successful. The benefit for travelers is convenience and information. They can find lodging, dining, and entertainment options, all in one spot. And from that one spot, they can compare prices, reserve rooms, make dinner reservations and so on. Call it the aggregation of their purchase journey.
The businesses that participate in the ecosystem must compete fiercely for attention—primarily by continually improving their offerings and the customer experience (CX). But access to TripAdvisor’s vast audience of potential customers makes the competitive pool well worth swimming in.
Companies at the forefront of digitizing their businesses recognize that they must compete in digital ecosystems, which Gartner defines as groupings of “enterprises, competitors, customers, regulators, and other stakeholders that exchange information and interact electronically.”73
Delivering Better CX Through Journey Aggregation
Just as TripAdvisor has aggregated the customer’s purchase journey for travel, so other journey aggregators will soon arise to establish digital ecosystems in just about every industry. These aggregators will succeed by simplifying complex purchase pathways, offering consumers a more streamlined, one-stop shopping experience. Even niche players and startups can grab significant market share (and put established competitors on notice) by participating in these ecosystems, thereby improving the customer journey while offering a better CX.
The opportunities in the digital universe are too large, too numerous, and too fleeting for any single company to capture on its own. But by assembling diverse coalitions of partners, developers, collaborators, suppliers, and others into mutually beneficial digital ecosystems, companies can explore new possibilities they could not hope to reach by themselves. The question will become this: Who should assemble these coalitions, and should the organizer be a consortium or an independent and impartial organization?
Many companies aren’t waiting to find out. Take Kabbage, a startup upending the world of small-business lending. The company recognized that small-business owners needed a faster, more convenient way to apply for and get decisions on loans.4 The company lets customers apply for loans through its website or mobile app. Loan applicants give Kabbage permission to access their data on payment processing, accounting, shipping and more, drawing from a long list of ecosystem partners like PayPal, eBay, Etsy, Square, Stripe, Intuit QuickBooks, Xero, and UPS. They can even let Kabbage gauge the strength of their social networks.
All this data helps Kabbage analyze revenue consistency, cash flow, and other factors that determine whether an applicant is a good credit risk, allowing it to make a lending decision in minutes. If a customer is approved for a line of credit up to $150,000, they can start using the funds the same day.
More recently, Kabbage has been forming partnerships and licensing its lending technology to banks such as Santander and Scotiabank. As of May 2016, the company had extended $2 billion in funding to 75,000 small-business customers based on more than 1 million data points.5
Kabbage’s partners are the lifeblood of its digital ecosystem. They possess the data Kabbage needs to make funding decisions and improve its customers’ borrowing experience. And if its partners’ customers get loans, they will be able to do more business with the firms in Kabbage’s digital ecosystem. That means more payment processing for PayPal, more shipping for UPS, and more accounting business for Intuit’s QuickBooks.
There’s another reason for companies to participate in digital ecosystems: If they don’t, they risk ending up on the outside looking in.
Higher Customer Expectations, Higher Stakes
Because so much business now is transacted digitally, customer expectations for their digital experience have risen.
Customers want instant service and convenience; they want a smooth interface. And many of them—especially those who have grown up in a world where people post details of their private lives on Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube, and more—are comfortable sharing their data with trusted companies if doing so will make their lives easier. Indeed, Kabbage’s COO and co-founder (Kathryn Petralia) says improving CX was the firm’s central goal. She predicts that the financial space will continue to evolve to provide “more seamless, flexible options.”6
But don’t be fooled into thinking that digital ecosystems are just for startups like Kabbage. Allianz, the Fortune Global 500 insurer, has created an ecosystem that extends from companies that provide sensing and monitoring services to plumbers, engineers, and health service providers, building open APIs as a platform for connectivity.7 So does the American insurance company USAA, which provides many products and services for its military family customers in their online car-buying journey8.
Historically, insurance companies have helped customers recover from disasters. By building a digital ecosystem that utilizes the massive volume of data generated by billions of connected devices that form the Internet of Things (IoT), Allianz sees a future in which insurance companies become proactive, watching over customers to prevent small problems from escalating. Instead of helping people repair their home after a flood, Allianz could alert a customer when a sensor detects a pipe beginning to leak. Instead of paying out a life insurance policy after a customer’s heart attack, Allianz could alert medical teams to abnormal data generated by an IoT heart monitor.
How to Deliver Amazing CX Through a Digital Ecosystem
Consumers will soon be purchasing many products and services from companies that participate in digital ecosystems. These ecosystems will make it easier for customers to tackle many steps in a larger purchase decision at the same time—not just searching real estate listings for a new house (step one), but simultaneously finding a real estate agent, a home inspector, a competitive mortgage rate, and service providers for any needed repairs or ongoing needs such as telephony, security, property maintenance, and others—that is, steps two through n, all at once, via a digital ecosystem.
How can a company deliver an amazing CX at every step in the customer’s purchase journey? Here are five steps:
Design to differentiate: Look for the biggest unsolved problems in your customers’ lives related to the product or service that you provide. Getting the basics right is a given; being a follower is no longer an option. To find out what these unsolved problems are, you need to ask your customers about them. Then use design thinking and service design approaches to solve those problems. For example, one insurance company realized its customers often struggled to provide the documentation necessary to replace items lost in a flood or fire. Accordingly, the company let consumers create a digital vault to store electronic copies of purchase receipts, along with photos and other supporting material for their most valuable possessions. This digital documentation helps the insurance company make the claims process faster, easier, and less stressful for the customer.
Gain a deeper understanding of customer needs: The best way to satisfy customers is to understand what they want, where they want it, and when. To calibrate offerings to individual customers, companies must possess robust data collection and analysis capabilities (or, like Kabbage, partner with ecosystem companies that do). When Amazon realized that customers wanted an even faster and easier way to transact, it produced a new device—Echo. Today, millions of people place orders via Echo simply by talking to Alexa, Amazon’s virtual agent.
Design for the future: Technology constantly advances. As you design the CX for your digital ecosystem, bake in the flexibility you’ll need for future upgrades. For instance, a large European telecommunications systems provider recently held a workshop to evaluate changes in CX over the past 100 years. By studying the drivers of past change, the company hopes to predict future change.
Include a community network: Consumers trust the recommendations of friends and family more than any other source. Two-thirds said they trusted opinions of other consumers posted online.9 TripAdvisor and Angie’s List (home services) have established platforms for consumers to share feedback on their experiences. This strategy has won Angie’s List more than 5 million members, powering the company to over $323 million in revenue and nearly $28 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2016.10 Incorporating community review into your digital ecosystem makes it more trustworthy. And consumers who trust your ecosystem will be more likely to use it and recommend it, creating a positive feedback loop.
Choose the right partners: The strength of any ecosystem—and the quality of its CX—relies on its participants. Look for partners that are leaders in their field, or startups with promising technological, operational, or strategic innovations. Work closely with your digital ecosystem partners so you can learn from one another and ensure your ecosystem contains no subpar experiences in the customer’s purchase journey.
Digital ecosystems are not a far-off twinkle in a futurist’s eye. In many sectors, they’re already here. In others, they will arise soon. Now is the time to evaluate your CX to see how it fits into the big picture.

23,"Thirty years ago, large global companies began building data warehouses—centralizing the information they gathered from customers in marketing, sales, and service interactions. About 10 years later, these firms began analyzing this data using customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Their aim: to increase revenue by identifying the most profitable, highest-value customers and to provide them with more targeted care and attention. The result would be a better customer experience, greater loyalty, and higher lifetime customer value.
Over the past 10 years, the rise of smartphones and social media has pushed companies to launch customer experience management (CXM) initiatives to improve and synchronize customers’ offline and online experiences and optimize touch points. Where CRM reacts to customer-initiated sales and service interactions, CXM takes a proactive approach—for instance, by monitoring and sometimes facilitating interactions on social media, discussion boards, or product review sites.
As CRM and CXM have become must-haves, many companies are now wondering how they can further differentiate and outdo their competition. This is especially important today because those competitors are also leveraging their own CRM systems and CXM touch points. We believe that the next logical step is for companies to provide value to their customers by using the customer data they’re already collected, and then helping those customers engage productively with other customers.
We refer to this as inter-customer relationship management, or ICRM to use an acronym. Many companies have done this for years, but in an ad-hoc way. For example, a mortgage banker might provide a list of local contractors to a customer with a home equity line of credit who is building a home addition. Or a home improvement store manager might recommend an electrician to a customer interested in upgrading their home’s lighting. Other firms, such as large investment banks and enterprise software companies, hold annual conferences that let customers network with each other. In these events, customers form relationships with other customers, some of which lead to business.
But with ICRM, we propose a deeper, more rigorous and more systematic approach to making these customer-to-customer business transactions happen. We believe that companies which offer ICRM capabilities will see a big rise in customer loyalty and profitability. Customers whose businesses thrive thanks to a supplier’s ICRM program will have the resources and the motivation to do more business with that supplier.
Taking Customer Relationships to the Next Level
To be sure, in pursuing their ICRM opportunities, companies cannot try to be all things to all people. An aircraft manufacturer might learn that a customer is not happy with his legal representation, but that doesn’t mean the manufacturer should acquire a law firm to offer legal services. But we do believe many companies have insights from the customer data they collect to identify customer needs that they cannot resolve themselves. What’s more, we believe these companies could introduce those customers to other customers of theirs that stand to be rewarded with both future revenue and increased loyalty.
What would ICRM look like in practice? Large companies would take existing customer data and adopt protocols for collecting new data on unfulfilled customer needs—needs that go beyond their ability to satisfy. Then they would use that data to generate insights about potential business synergies among customers.
It’s important not to confuse ICRM with similar-sounding models. ICRM is not synonymous with consumer-to-consumer (C2C) commerce. C2C applies to platforms like eBay and Craigslist that let consumers buy and sell products (and occasionally services) from one another. Typically, these ‘relationships’ are isolated and transactional. Hopefully, each party is satisfied with the transaction, but they are unlikely to form an ongoing commercial relationship. By contrast, part of an ICRM program’s goal is to help customers forge ongoing and mutually beneficial business relationships.
There is also a difference in scale. While Craigslist and eBay can be used for large-dollar transactions, as the name C2C suggests, they mostly enable smaller consumer-to-consumer transactions. ICRM could be used for this purpose, but its real potential is for larger transactions.
For example, a consulting firm might discover that the CEO of a private equity client likes Swiss watches, but it would not necessarily use ICRM to connect the CEO with another client looking to sell a Swiss watch. Instead, it might use ICRM to connect the private equity CEO with another client—let’s say a Swiss watch manufacturer—looking for an investor. In other words, the ICRM system would generate insights on the CEO’s interests and search its customer ecosystem to see if they align with identified business opportunities.
While C2C platforms offer some protection and guarantees, C2C is largely a buyer-beware world. C2C platforms provide opportunities for participants to rate one another, yet buyers and sellers take a leap of faith when doing business they don’t know on the other side of the transaction. In contrast, we envision ICRM as a walled garden. Customers would know that when they do business with another party, that party has been vetted and chosen for them by a trusted third-party—the company running the ICRM program.
Some companies have begun to recognize the value of facilitating relationships among customers, and have taken small steps in that direction. For years, large software companies such as Oracle, SAP, and Salesforce, and investment banks such as Allen & Co. have held conferences where customers are encouraged to mingle. Many profitable deals have been struck thanks to connections made at these conferences.
While these events and the connections they spawn provide mutual benefit to most participants, they are not ICRM. At a conference, the onus is on customers to seek each other out; they have no way of knowing which of the dozens and sometimes hundreds of attendees would be the best fit for their business needs.
In contrast, an ICRM operator would make specific suggestions, introducing customers to one or perhaps a few fellow customers that are most likely (in the ICRM operator’s ‘data-informed’ judgment) to result in a beneficial business relationship. Data that supported these matches would also be made available to each party.
From Expense to Revenue Source
By operating an ICRM program, a company would be able to help its customers solve pressing needs, grow their businesses and become more profitable. As a result, customers may start to see the ICRM provider as a revenue generator and business partner. In this way, ICRM makes the relationship between the customer and the company operating the ICRM system stickier. Customers will be less likely to move if they know their fellow customers are potential new business opportunities.
The Internet has made it easy for customers to find alternative vendors. It has also given out-of-market players new opportunities to enter service sectors like banking and insurance, and quickly siphon off customers. Consequently, customer retention has become even more critical to every company’s bottom line.
Studies show that acquiring a new customer costs anywhere from five to 25 times more than retaining an existing one.1
To the extent that ICRM can improve customer satisfaction, it has a good chance of also increasing customer retention. A 2016 study found that retailers and publishers which increased spending on customer retention in the last one to three years had an almost 200% higher likelihood of increasing market share than those that increased spending on customer acquisition.2
How to Build an ICRM Program
So what does it take to implement a robust ICRM?
First, it requires a digital engine for automating the large-scale identification of inter-customer business opportunities. This engine should be able to incorporate social media monitoring and text analysis.
Many companies monitor social media to keep tabs on customer sentiments and respond to nascent PR problems. In an ICRM context, social media allows companies to identify not just customer complaints, but also unmet needs. In some cases, the company itself might be able to fill those needs; in others, it could use its ICRM program to find another customer that can.
For example, a bank monitoring a customer’s Facebook feed might learn that its customer is planning an addition to his home. For the bank, this is a dual opportunity: first, to provide a loan, and second, to find building contractors who are also bank customers. The bank, then, could offer to connect suitable contractors to customers who are expanding their homes. Figure 8 shows how ICRM could increase value for a bank customer working as a contractor.
To reach ICRM’s full potential, you’ll need technology that can gather and analyze unstructured data. You’ll also need to enhance your customer profiling to gain better visibility into the products and services (and their quality) that your customers can provide to other customers.
Ideally, your ICRM program should also be able to track these referrals to see whether they have generated the desired business benefits for your customers—a key indicator of program success.

Figure 1: What ICRM Might Look Like at a Bank
You’ll also need to decide how hands-on you want to be with the administration of the program. For example, do you want to automate the ICRM program so your IT systems can compose and distribute messages to customers when data analysis reveals potential matches between unmet needs and qualified providers? Or do you want a human to vet matches before you make them? Perhaps your company wants to play a larger role in these connections, with a senior manager making the final decision on whether to make the connection, and then facilitating introductions with a call or email?
The Path to Inter-Customer Relationship Management for Financial Institutions
Banks are commonly organized around product groups, so the typical question they ask is, “Who can we sell a CD, credit card, or home equity line of credit to?”
This product-centered approach often leads to uncoordinated, inefficient communications with customers. Secondly, there is very little consideration given to individual customer needs or interests. The net result is often a disappointing customer response, with customers more likely to view marketing activities based on this strategy as an unwelcome intrusion.
‘Next Best Action’ strategy, on the other hand, is structured around what you know about that individual customer. Customers are only offered financial products and services relevant to their needs and the bank develops a deeper, more valuable relationship with the customer. Initiating this level of insight for an ICRM initiative is not very different from current Next Best Action usage. You are providing an offer that, if accepted, will generate ongoing value for each party in the transaction. In the case of ICRM, that would be the respondent, the other customer and the financial institution that initiates the connection.
How To Start
To begin an ICRM program, make sure your CRM and CXM systems are identifying customer needs your company can’t fill, but which other customers might be able to. Marketing, sales, and service functions should understand that capturing this data is a business priority.
The banking industry is well-positioned to take the lead in developing and implementing ICRM programs. The reason is that banks already have processes to vet customer trustworthiness and financial stability. Customers trust their banks to safeguard their money. It would not be a great leap for a bank’s customers to extend their trust to fellow customers introduced to them by that bank. In addition, bank officers often develop personal relationships with a wide network of clients through retail branch networks.
ICRM pioneers should expect to tackle several challenging questions. For instance:

Would customers opt-in to an ICRM program, or would they automatically be registered unless they opted out?

To what extent would the ICRM operator vouch for each customer when making a connection? And how would the ICRM operator respond if a “match” turned out to be unsuccessful and even acrimonious?

Should the ICRM program pull from external databases (e.g., the Better Business Bureau or Yelp) to help customers assess recommendations?

How would customers provide feedback on their ICRM experience? What mechanism could be put in place? Would that feedback be available to other ICRM participants (which is the eBay model)? Or would the feedback only be accessible to the ICRM administrator?


As with any new initiative, ICRM trailblazers will need to experiment to find their way.In a world where at some point CRM and CXM initiatives are no longer providing significant competitive differentiators, companies that gain a first-mover advantage in developing ICRM programs could add significant value for their customers, and help themselves stand out from the crowd.

24,"Even for companies that can afford billions of dollars in IT investments, the economics of putting information technology in the cloud are undeniable. Huge capital expenditures turn into operating expenses, and the headaches and complexities of running secure data centers becomes someone else’s responsibility. The testing of crucial but new compute-intensive business capabilities can suddenly be done on the spot, and on the cheap. 
This is the reason why The Coca-Cola Company this year has shifted more than 20% of its IT to the cloud and put a for-sale sign on its Atlanta data center.1 This is also why 207 companies surveyed by JP Morgan with IT budgets of at least $600 million expect to increase their cloud workloads from 16% to 41% in five years.2 The message is becoming clear—for a growing number of global companies, the default location for their hardware and software will be the cloud. Like the office fax machine and the typing pool, running IT ‘on-premises’ will soon become a quaint notion for many systems of many companies.
However, transferring a company’s computing workload to public cloud vendor facilities promises to be anything but easy. The companies that TCS is helping do so, which include a global chemicals firm, a major business information provider and a large industrial manufacturer, are immediately confronted with two fundamental questions.
1. WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD COMPANIES MOVE TO THE CLOUD FIRST?
2. HOW SHOULD THEY DO SO WITHOUT WREAKING HAVOC ON THEIR DAILY BUSINESS?
This article addresses these two questions, drawing on our experiences and expertise in helping large companies move their IT to public clouds.
1. What Should Move to the Cloud First
The economics of shifting IT to public cloud vendors’ data centers are inescapable. Companies that can easily ‘lift and shift’ long-standing business applications, which consume huge amounts of servers, storage and other data center technology, should be seriously investigating their public cloud options. Cheered on by their CFOs, they will be able to turn much of their big annual capital expenditures involved in running their data centers into operating expenditures.
Unfortunately, many business applications are not easy to simply ‘lift and shift’. A company that decides to move a big enterprise resource planning system (ERP) from its data centers to a public cloud runs the risk of significant disruption to its business when it does so, and thus it needs to plan accordingly. The reason for the disruption is that moving on-premises ERP to an ERP vendor’s cloud (Oracle, SAP, etc.) essentially is a new implementation of the technology—an upgrade to the latest version. What is more, most ERP systems, especially those installed years ago, have been significantly modified to suit a company’s geographic and industry-specific needs. Much of that customized functionality is not likely to be available in a plain vanilla ERP cloud offering. Thus, shifting on-premises ERP to ERP-in-the-cloud may entail significant customization of the type that may have taken months or years to do with the on-premises version.
A major chemical company has nearly 100 versions of an ERP system in its data centers, and each version has been customized to varying degrees. Moving that system to the cloud is likely to be painful given all the customization that would need to be done on the ERP vendor’s latest (cloud) version of the system.
Owing to such extensive customization, some companies have decided not to take their ERP systems directly to a public cloud but rather to a privately owned cloud. One example is Qantas, Australia’s largest airline. When it was time to upgrade its on-premises Oracle ERP system, the airline turned to a private cloud implementation. Instead of moving to the latest on-premises version, Qantas took advantage of new functionality, enhancing user experience, in the E-Business Suite 12 through a private cloud. “This was a huge opportunity to streamline and improve performance,” said Eric Pona, technology manager for enterprise systems at Qantas.3
If the plan is to eventually shift your on-premises ERP platform to the cloud, then the least disruptive way is to shift those parts of the enterprise application that adhere more closely to the standard version sold by the ERP vendor—that is, the modules your firm has not extensively customized. In many companies, these modules are in finance and order management.
Envisioning the Critical New Computer Workloads of the Future
When many companies think about the cloud, they look only at moving applications and IT infrastructure that currently run in their data centers. What they forget are the whole new applications that suddenly become available because the cost of bringing in the technology to run them has fallen to near zero. If your company wants to offer customers a new IT-intensive product or a new digital way of doing business but hesitates because it requires a huge investment in additional IT infrastructure, you need to hesitate no more. This is possible because the cost of that infrastructure today is no longer an issue. You can buy such computing resources by the hour at affordable prices.
An excellent example is how streaming movie and TV programming pioneer Netflix Inc. was able to scale its streaming video business. After launching the business in 2007,4 the company decided three years later that it needed to move its existing technology to a company that was in the data center business—Amazon Web Services. “With the shift to streaming, our software needs to be much more reliable, redundant, and fault tolerant,” wrote Netflix VP of product engineering at the time, John Ciancutti, in a corporate blog post in 2010. “We could have chosen to build out new data centers, build our own redundancy and failover, data synchronization systems, etc. Or, we could opt to write a check to someone else to do that instead.” Running what he said was one of the biggest cloud computing environments in the world, Netflix decided its engineers had to focus on “product innovation for the customer experience,” adding “that is what differentiates us from our competitors”—not the increasingly complex and costly data center infrastructure behind it.5
A major provider of information to businesses is making a big push to the cloud for a similar reason—to give customers better ways for using its data online. Customers want to rapidly analyze the firm’s data and in numerous ways, and not wait for the company to do the analysis for them. This means providing customers with sophisticated online tools, which in turn requires extensive computing power. The company is in the process of re-architecting those systems and putting them on a public cloud so that customers can get what they need.
Dramatically improving the customer’s online experience is also what drove U.S. based financial services and credit card company Capital One Financial Corp. to the cloud. The company’s CIO, Rob Alexander, says the company’s online banking experience is becoming the most important one for its customers.
“We really need to be great at building amazing digital experiences for our customers,” Rob Alexander, CIO at the $20 billion (revenue) company, said in a conference presentation.6 “We have to be great at building software and data products if we’re going to win where banking is going.”7
To be sure, Netflix, Capital One and the business information provider mentioned above are not the only companies that now find themselves competing in an online world against ferocious online players. Perhaps the best illustration of this is that Netflix’s cloud provider Amazon now competes against the company in the world of streaming TV shows and movies. Those business partners in the cloud are now competitors too.
A growing number of other firms in industries ranging from automotive manufacturing and banking to media and travel compete today on the basis of the online products and capabilities that they offer. In the future, car buyers should be expected to increasingly compare cars on the basis of their telematics and ‘infotainment’ capabilities. For instance, what one manufacturer’s onboard GPS system can do that another’s cannot do may become a major influence in the buying decision. Like Netflix, Capital One and the business information company we mentioned, automakers too must have the data center resources to compete in a digital-intensive world of online business.
2. HOW TO MOVE IT TO THE CLOUD
Once you have determined what existing IT applications and infrastructure your firm should shift to the cloud—and the new IT capabilities that should be built in the cloud from the start—the next big consideration is how to make that shift. Based on our cloud migration work with clients, we believe you are likely to encounter six situations, and urge you to be ready to manage them.
You will spend at least double the amount of time than you thought to take inventory of your application portfolio. We call this the ‘discovery’ phase. To determine what computer applications should be shifted from on-premises systems to the cloud, CIOs must first understand exactly what applications are running in their data centers. From our experience, when a company initially believes it has around 500-600 applications running across its global business, it is often shocked to find out the number is two to three times that many when the audit is done. And we are not including personal applications such as Excel that are housed on PCs or laptops. Many of these extra apps are what are referred to as ‘ghost apps’ because they are so old that the company that developed them either does not support them anymore or is out of business altogether. Such ghost apps, then, may need to be entirely rewritten to become cloud versions—a major undertaking. Another business information provider that has been shifting to the cloud discovered a ghost app three years ago. The app provided a critical component to managing customer subscriptions. The app vendor had gone out of business long ago. When the information provider began its transition to the cloud, it started with its ERP system and left the ghost app untouched.
Expect to re-architect a good percentage of cloud applications without having updated design and architecture documents at hand. For those applications that you have decided must be revamped for the cloud—a new design and a computing architecture—be ready to find that the original documents that explain their design and architecture are either missing or grossly outdated. This is especially true for custom applications built years ago. Three years ago, according to Forrester, companies were spending about the same amount on custom applications as they were on packaged applications—about 26% for customer apps and 26% for packaged applications out of total spending on applications software.8 In determining which pieces of the applications portfolio should move to the cloud and when, companies are likely to find that as much as three-quarters of that portfolio are custom applications. That is because many applications were built long ago before viable packaged versions existed. The problem that such packaged software presents is equivalent to the one that science fiction writer Isaac Asimov warned about in his writing on robots: the machinery still works but nobody knows why. Today’s business applications are very much in the same condition. There is no one left in the company who can explain how they work.
To minimize disruptions to the business, cut over in phases defined by business function rather than by data centers. The easiest way for many IT departments to shift applications and infrastructure to the cloud is to do it one data center at a time. But that often is not the easiest way for a company’s business functions to shift their systems to the cloud. Ultimately, a shift to the cloud should be a shift that strengthens a company’s business functions and products or service offerings—not just one that reduces the IT cost structure. A marketing function’s applications, for example, may reside in multiple data centers. As a result, shifting to the cloud one data center at a time will force marketers to learn, test, and use new cloud-based systems over a long period of time rather than in a concentrated one. Better to identify all the marketing applications that should be put in the cloud, and then plan their migration in a shorter—not extended—period of time. For the IT organization, the data center is the logical unit of work, especially if a firm’s data centers are outsourced to third parties. In cloud migrations however, the unit of work should be the business function.
In deciding what business functions should go first, determine the connections among applications. Chances are most applications in a business function are connected to other systems in that function rather than to systems in other functions—other than, of course, those cross-functional ERP systems. Ensure applications that are tightly knotted to other applications are identified and moved concurrently in batches. Functional applications that are integrated with ERP systems should be migrated to the cloud together, so that the business function is not disrupted on two different occasions.
Recognize the idiosyncratic IT needs of different geographies when determining how to batch the cloud migration. Data privacy and other information security laws may vary from country to country, and in different continents too. For example, overlooking Europe’s rules on employee data privacy may create problems if that data is not kept in the country where a company’s on-premises system was located. If you have country-specific applications, put them into a single batch and do them all at once. The professionals behind cloud migrations must pay close attention to data privacy and security regulations.
Know in advance how you will test your new cloud systems before migrating to them. You need to have a strategy for stress-testing the software early on. A chemical company that is moving to the cloud will have one vendor’s responsibilities in testing to end at so-called smoke testing—an initial testing to ensure that the most critical aspects of the system work well. However, more advanced levels of testing should be in place. For example, integration testing (to test how multiple applications work together) and performance testing (which typically include testing an application’s connection to a network and its response time for users). It is one thing to have a cloud system operating on AWS or Microsoft’s Azure platform. It is a much bigger challenge to have a part of an application on one cloud platform and another running an on-premises system. The networks that link those two systems can become huge performance issues.
Taking the Lighter Path
The number of companies moving down the path to the cloud has risen from a trickle to a torrent. Every company now needs to evaluate the opportunities of public clouds. Big reductions in IT capital expenses and the availability of enormous amounts of online computing power—all without significant capital costs. The meteoric rise of Netflix in the world of streaming video, and Capital One’s moves in the fast-evolving landscape for online banks, show what happens to companies that read the tea leaves early. The public cloud becomes a key competitive tool. Even upstart taxi icon Uber was reportedly looking this spring to put some of its extensive technology infrastructure into a public cloud.9
To determine an effective path to the cloud, companies must have solid answers to the questions of what to move to the cloud, and how to do so without upending the business.
Their answer to the first question needs to factor not only what current systems should be ported over to the cloud, but also what new, previously impractical digital capabilities are now possible—as the computing infrastructure for it can now be rented, not purchased.
With a cloud strategy in hand, the next step is about anticipating the bottlenecks of taking inventory of a potentially massive application portfolio. The cloud strategy should also include re-architecting many cloud applications, minimizing disruptions to business functions, understanding the connections among applications, knowing how IT needs may vary by geography, and determining how to test new cloud systems before cutting over to them.
Companies that are well prepared for these challenges will make a smooth transition to the next great world of computing.

25,"Whether it’s a series of tweaks or a wholesale transformation, every customer experience initiative will run into roadblocks along the way. They can throw the program off track or even derail it altogether. Such bumps include turf battles among customer-facing functions, over-optimistic expectations of untested technologies and poor project management.
However, one factor can help a CX initiative withstand even multiple setbacks along the way: a deeply involved CEO. From our client work, and from studying transformations at other companies, we’ve seen five instrumental roles that CEOs have played in successful CX initiatives: consensus builder, experience unifier, influential designer, chief customer advocate and thought leader.
I’ll examine each role and illustrate them with examples from such companies as Domino’s Pizza, Burberry, Pepsi, Virgin Group and Airbnb.
One factor can help a CX initiative withstand even multiple setbacks along the way: a deeply involved CEO.
1. Consensus Builder: Convincing Key Constituencies to Go Along
Some CX initiatives cost companies a great deal of money. And even when the potential returns are projected to be multiple times the investment, these programs can create anxiety among key stakeholders: board directors, division leaders, functional heads, and highly influential CFOs. In these cases, a convincing CEO can be the only force that gets the program off the ground. The experience of Domino’s Pizza Inc. CEO, Patrick Doyle, is a perfect case in point.
Domino’s is an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company that delivers pizza direct from its pizza-making operations around the U.S. and other countries to consumers, businesses, homes, and offices. Back in 2010, the company’s growth had stalled, and its share price was less than $10. From comments that customers made on social media, its phone lines, and other places, Doyle got the message: Domino’s pizza wasn’t good enough. That year, he even went public with such comments in a TV commercial (e.g., “Worst excuse for pizza I ever had”). He vowed to fix it.
But after customers, the next group Doyle had to convince was Domino’s franchisees—the 1,100 business people who owned 90% of the chain’s U.S. locations back then. This would not be an easy group to persuade. Their businesses were hurting badly (the Great Recession of 2009 hadn’t helped). And part of making the pizza better and delivering it faster required them to make substantial investments.
So how did Doyle do it? Through extensive consumer research that showed the pizza had to get much better, and customers would embrace the improvements that corporate had experimented with. It took 18 months to research and analyze what the company needed and get buy-in from franchisees. But it worked. “The fundamental starting point for getting buy-in … was very thoroughly [thinking through] how it is going to affect everybody,” he said.1 “If you do that, then it starts to get a lot easier. … They are going to understand that you have done that work.”
Says Doyle: “You want to build consensus as often as you can. That’s what gives you the |credibility to, every once in a while, hope that most of the people will line up behind you.”2
Today, Domino’s is vibrant again, with a stock price approaching $200 a share, revenue of $2.5 billion in 2016 (more than three times the number in 20103), and profits of more than $200 million.
2. Unifier: Getting Everyone on the Same Page
One reason why many companies launch organization-wide CX transformations is that the experiences they offer are highly inconsistent. This happens frequently in industries such as retailing and restaurants, where customers in one country or a region of that country encounter very different experiences or even a very different set of products.
One company suffering from this malady was UK apparel retailer Burberry in 2006. Back then, the company known for its iconic trench coats was growing only 2% a year. (It was a $1.2 billion firm at the time.)4 Its products and store experiences had become highly inconsistent. “An experience in any given Burberry store in the world might be very different from the customer’s previous one,” said Angela Ahrendts, a new CEO brought in that year to turn around the company.5
That was a huge problem, she believed. “From Apple to Starbucks, I love the consistency—knowing that anywhere in the world you can depend on having the same experience in the store or being served latte with the same taste and in the same cup. That’s great branding.”
What did Ahrendts do? She immediately appointed a ‘brand czar’ (Christopher Bailey) to set a global design for all its apparel and its stores. She told her management team that “anything that the consumer sees anywhere in the world will go through [Bailey’s] office. No exceptions.”
Then to unify the design of products and store experiences, Ahrendts and Bailey started with Burberry’s famous trench coat, a product whose price tag can exceed $1,000. (It was worn by British soldiers in World War I, and by Hollywood stars in films ever since.) With products now designed in one place (not multiple sites around the world), the design team revamped the trench coat to appeal to the next wave of buyers: millennials. The designers came up with more styles and colors. They also united a series of regional company websites into one global platform. (This global site generates more online visitors every week than the number who walk through the company’s stores in total.) And they had a video produced that showed the trench coat’s craftsmanship. Store salespeople were instructed to play this video on their new iPad tablet devices, and many customers were impressed when they watched.
“From Apple to Starbucks, I love the consistency—knowing that anywhere in the world you can depend on having the same experience in the store or being served latte with the same taste and in the same cup. That’s great branding.”
By 2012, Burberry was back in growth mode. Revenue had nearly tripled to $3 billion from the number in 2006, and operating income more than doubled (to $600 million from $250 million). Ahrendts’ skill in unifying the CX brought new glory to Burberry. And her reputation for creating a great and highly consistent CX attracted the eye of Apple Inc., which hired her in 2014 to run its then-$21 billion-a-year global business6 of Apple stores.7
3. Influential Designer: Putting a Thumbprint on the Experience to Come
Two CEOs have played important roles this decade in helping design their companies’ customer experiences: Pepsi and Airbnb. Around 2010, Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi was perplexed by the company’s flat growth. She decided to take a customer’s view of the problem, and went to a grocery store every week as a ‘mom’—not as a CEO—to answer this question: “What products really speak to me?”8 From a CX standpoint, Pepsi’s products did not.
Nooyi then told the executives who report to her to take a camera and an empty photo album and snap photos of products that they thought were designed well. The results were disappointing. Only a few brought back photo albums. “Some had their wives take pictures. Many did nothing at all. They didn’t know what design was,” Nooyi wrote in a 2015 Harvard Business Review article. A few Pepsi executives thought design was merely about the colors and logos used in packaging. They considered it to be “like putting lipstick on a pig, as opposed to redesigning the pig itself,” she said.
At that point, Nooyi realized Pepsi had to hire a top designer. In 2012, that person (Mauro Porcini) became the first chief design officer in the company’s 118-year history. “In the past, user experience wasn’t part of our lexicon,” Nooyi said. “Focusing on crunch, taste, and everything else now pushes us to rethink shape, packaging, form, and function.” Porcini has since been helping Pepsi design the entire CX—from seeing the product on a shelf to the Pepsi fountain machine where customers pour their drinks.
Since then, Pepsi’s CX design initiative—ignited by CEO Nooyi—has had impact. It’s helped a new beverage product (Mountain Dew Kickstart) generate more than $200 million in revenue in two years—not an easy feat in the food industry. It comes in a slim can and tastes nothing like the old Mountain Dew. And it appeals to women who want a lower-calorie but tasty beverage.9 Moreover, the company no longer outsources design to marketing agencies. Pepsi has brought the design function inside, and design thinking into nearly every major company decision.
Airbnb’s CEO (Brian Chesky) took a similar but different approach. In 2011, he read in Walt Disney’s biography about how the legendary cartoonist created the Snow White movie in the mid-1930s: storyboarding the tale before putting it to his cartoon animators. Chesky and his management team decided to do something similar: storyboard the experiences of their three main stakeholders: hosts (the people who rent their apartments, condos, or houses), guests, and employees. “When you have to storyboard something, the more realistic it is, the more decisions you have to make,” he says.10 Who exactly are the customers? What emotions do they have when they purchase and use your product? By storyboarding the travelers’ experience at an Airbnb rental, the company thought more clearly about who the customer is. Are they men or women? Are they young or old? Do they live in cities, suburbs, or in the countryside?
Pepsi has brought the design function inside, and design thinking into nearly every major company decision.
Interestingly, only two of the 33 storyboards (drawn by a Pixar artist that Chesky hired) were about a traveler at an Airbnb rental unit. That helped the management team identify new opportunities to pursue, one of which is travel excursions. After storyboarding the CX, they realized that many vacations can be dull. Through subsequent research, they found that many customers would opt for memorable excursions such as attending costume parties and midnight bike rides.11
By initiating storyboard-based design thinking into the Airbnb CX, CEO Chesky set the company into hyper-growth mode. The privately held firm generated a profit of more than $100 million on $1.7 billion in revenue in 2016, according to one media report. And Airbnb is projected to quintuple that revenue by 2020.12 Not bad for a company whose latest round of venture funding valued it at $31 billion.13
4. Customer Advocates: Putting the Customer in the Design Room
No company is as focused on customers as online retailer Amazon.com. Its ascension to become one of the world’s biggest retailers—in bricks or clicks ($136 billion in revenue)—is a testimony to constantly sweating the details of how it deals with customers. As founding CEO Jeff Bezos told a reporter: “We’re not competitor-obsessed. We’re customer-obsessed. We start with what the customer needs and we work backwards.” That relentless focus on customers remains at Amazon, regardless of whether the company is making money. “We don’t focus on the optics of the next quarter,” Bezos has said. “We focus on what is going to be good for customers. I think this aspect of our culture is rare.”14
In Amazon’s early days, one way Bezos kept the customer front and center was by placing an empty chair in the room for management meetings. He designated that chair as the customer’s chair, and ‘the most important person in the room’. That set Amazon’s early mindset of being customer obsessed.
5. Thought Leader: CEO as CX Expert
It does a company significant good when the very top of the organization demonstrates an affinity for customers, and a company’s CEO is its best public ‘thought leader.’ Several CEOs have played this role before, during, and after their companies’ CX overhauls—and very publicly. One of the best known is Virgin Group’s founder Sir Richard Branson. “Every action Branson takes and every word he speaks—whether the cameras are on or off—reflect his commitment to creating an exceptional experience for both his customers and employees,” said marketing consultant Carmine Gallo after accompanying Branson on his airline’s first flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.15
Branson’s reason for writing and speaking prolifically is brand management: It shows just how customer-obsessed the Virgin Group is. The obsession has helped build an organization that generates $24 billion a year in revenue and employs more than 71,000 people. “A good leader doesn’t get stuck behind a desk,” Branson told Gallo.16 “Anybody can sell a cup of coffee. Anyone can buy an airplane, and we all buy planes from the same manufacturers. But there the difference stops. If you fly on a Virgin plane … you know you’re going to have a completely different experience.”
Branson has been highly visible for years as a public advocate in the sectors where his 60+ companies have competed: airlines, music, banking, cable TV, and beverages, to name a few. He appears to write in his blog every day. He published a book in 2014 on leadership (The Virgin Way) and an autobiography three years before that (Losing My Virginity). He has more than 11 million followers on LinkedIn, a professional social network for which he has authored nearly 100 articles since 2012. He also has his own Twitter account (with 10.6 million followers), one that he doesn’t delegate.
As a well-published CEO, Branson has helped the company become known for customer excellence. Virgin boasts of brand recognition in the 90th percentile in the UK, the U.S., France, Australia and other countries.17
There are at least three other good reasons for CEOs to become more visible in CX initiatives. One is that when the big boss is passionate about something, the rest of the organization tends to get passionate too. Another is that when that boss is a key contributor, it forces the executive with daily oversight (in this case, the head of CX) to raise her game. She needs to show that she knows more than the boss about CX.
Finally, it immeasurably helps any CX initiative to have a well-informed and influential tie-breaker on big decisions. And you should fully expect that a CX transformation will bring many of those decisions to the fore.
In these five ways, CEOs can play highly influential roles in their companies’ CX transformations. As these initiatives increasingly play for higher stakes, more and more CEOs should consider whether they should be playing one or more of these roles.

"
26,"A few years ago, two airlines announced a merger they said would bring tremendous synergies and increases in flights for customers. With a doubling of flights, the extra coverage came quickly, but the synergies did not. That is because they were difficult to secure—crucial decisions on which pricing and other key business systems to choose, how to reduce duplications in business processes and their supporting IT infrastructure, and how to merge staffs. The integration took months longer than the companies expected, and mistakes were made—a superior pricing system was discarded for an inferior one, valuable employees left in droves, and more.
Unfortunately, stories such as this one are still common today. Companies that merge with others are unable to rapidly integrate IT-intensive business processes, systems and functions. They wind up paying a steep cost.

To be sure, mergers and acquisitions have always been, and will always be, a powerful tool for companies to get lighter—to generate more revenue at less proportional cost. And the most successful mergers are ones in which the efficiencies happen quickly. The pursuit of such synergies is a core reason why global M&A has continued to race along at a breakneck pace since 2010—from 3% to 6% of global GDP.1
It is no surprise then that acquiring companies increasingly are scrutinizing the potential synergies, before and after the acquisition. Those include business processes that are IT intensive and which can be combined (such as online marketing), data centers and IT infrastructure, and the professionals to keep the processes and systems going. Given that information technology spending is one of the single largest categories of costs nowadays, achieving the synergies can do much to improve the bottom line (and sometimes even the top line) in the first year.
In fact, McKinsey & Company estimates that 50% to 60% of post-merger synergies are related to combining such IT-related activities. In healthcare, it found 15% of synergies come directly from lowering IT infrastructure expenses, reducing IT personnel, and gaining bigger volume discounts from IT suppliers. But in financial services, the prize is even bigger—25% of the synergies can come from combining two companies’ IT activities. Another 35% can be achieved from what McKinsey called ‘IT-enabled’ moves: for example, reducing finance and HR expenses through connecting their systems, cutting logistics costs through optimizing distribution routes, and more cross-selling by integrating customer data.2
But doing all this in a short period of time can be a nightmare with unintended consequences. McKinsey’s research found most IT-related merger issues were not fully resolved even in the early stages of post-merger planning.
Another study, conducted in 2007, found IT integration to be ignored in four out of five acquisitions. More than a third of the companies surveyed did not think they would integrate the IT functions within two years after their mergers.3
This is not at all a surprise to us. Recently, a multilbillion dollar electronics company that was about to make several acquisitions turned to us for advice. It was not sure what to do with the IT functions and IT-intensive business processes of those firms, and whether and how to combine them with its own IT staff.
Combining business processes and IT departments post-merger can be fraught with hazards, unless both companies have prepared for it long in advance. It is like training to run a marathon—if you are about to run your first one after only a few of weeks of training, you are unlikely to finish the 26.2 miles. Preparing your organization for a merger—just like preparing for a marathon—requires extensive planning and preparation months before the event begins. This applies to the parties on both sides of the deal.
If you are not prepared, three major problems can ensue:

Much longer times to generate synergies

Better business processes, systems, and technologies (typically, those of the company being acquired) being discarded in favor of inferior systems—even when the superior systems provide distinct competitive advantages

An exodus of highly valuable business process and IT people


This article provides an overview of the preparation that will be necessary for companies that make multiple acquisitions. CIOs of both companies involved in the M&A must understand this process if their systems and staffs are to survive. The two CIOs must thoroughly understand their departments’ assets, costs, and performance.
Why Due Diligence Often Falls Short
Why are the business process and IT implications of acquisitions too often underappreciated in deal planning? From our experience, it is because the parties responsible for identifying acquisitions (investment bankers) and making them work (management consulting firms) are focused elsewhere. In due diligence, the focus is on two companies’ operating models, products/services, markets, and distribution channels. The finance departments are looking at numbers. Yet all too often, no one is looking closely at IT-intensive business processes and IT operations, and the IT leaders at these companies are rarely involved.
But that is changing now. In fact, some of the best companies at integrating businesses after mergers—private equity firms—are paying close attention to combining IT-intensive business processes and related systems post-acquisition.
Companies that merge IT-intensive processes effectively make IT a core competency of the overall M&A plan, not a muscle that they develop and exercise only when a new deal is at hand.
Rather, they train for M&A as if it is a marathon they will run for the foreseeable future. It enables them to finish the race every time there is a deal, and quickly.
To accomplish this, companies need to possess strong capabilities in evaluating a target acquisition’s IT-intensive processes, infrastructure, and business process and IT professionals. And, ironically, they need to have an even stronger understanding of their own capabilities. Otherwise, when asked to make apples-to-apples comparison between their infrastructure and a target companies’ infrastructure, they will not know which one is better.
Companies that best integrate their business processes and IT after a merger also possess an overall philosophy about the best ways to manage such operations, especially the steps that make integration faster, less risky and less expensive. Those that do this right can integrate these operations in six months or less, rather than the twelve to eighteen months it often takes.
The Six Practices That Accelerate M&A
From helping a number of companies make such merger integration work, we have found six practices to be crucial
1. Building an M&A center of excellence. Large companies have built centers of excellence (COEs) for many functions and activities—finance, supply chains, and customer support operations. For example, industrial manufacturer 3M has supply chain COEs that help it manufacture and distribute its products in new international markets.4 Such COEs employ a core staff that works full-time on continually honing their skills and a playbook that defines the elements and steps of their COE’s topic focus. Few COEs exist today in big companies for M&A in general, much less the IT-related operations that are merged. But to become highly accomplished at doing it quickly, companies need a COE that continually refines its practices based on the latest acquisitions.
2. Creating stringent and demanding metrics for synergies. Time is the great killer of potential synergies—from cost savings, new revenue from cross-selling, and so on. In merging IT-related operations, moving fast is key to getting such benefits. But this means setting an aggressive timetable for deciding which IT-intensive business processes, applications, infrastructure, and personnel to keep for merging the systems and reducing the data center footprint. One global chemical company has conducted studies to determine best practices in M&A integration, especially to understand how fast such operations of two companies can be merged. All this is analogous to the best marathoners—they always pay careful attention to their race times and practice times. Software companies like Oracle and SAP that have made many acquisitions over the years have become skilled at merging other software companies’ business processes and systems onto their platforms quickly. Just five years ago, Oracle could integrate most acquisitions in six months or less.5
3. Intimately knowing your operational infrastructure. In the merger of the two airlines mentioned at the beginning of this article, the IT function of the airline that was purchased put itself at a huge disadvantage after the deal closed because it had not thoroughly documented its performance. This was unfortunate because the company had a superior pricing system. But it was not prepared to have a bakeoff with the acquirer for this pricing system—or any other system. The acquirer was known for its cost-driven culture. The acquired company, in contrast, was famous for a culture of service excellence. Shortly after the deal closed, the CEO of the acquirer asked his two CIOs to benchmark their departments’ IT performance and evaluate each one’s pricing systems. The acquiring company had an inferior system, but because the CIO was well prepared—having done rigorous analyses of his function and its systems, including his pricing system—that system won. Despite having a better system, the acquired company lost out because its CIO could not answer important questions, such as how many systems would be affected in the merger. An answer of ‘hundreds’ was not nearly precise enough.
Having an in-depth and documented understanding of a company’s infrastructure (business processes, systems, core data, their performance, dependencies on other systems, etc.) alone can save 35% to 40% of the time it takes to integrate two big IT departments. When it is in hand, the analysis—the bake off—should be able to happen in a month. When that data is not there, it can take many months to pull it together. Possessing all the pertinent facts about your infrastructure will greatly reduce the chances that superior systems and people go by the wayside, the victims of political decisions based on whose leader is the superior storyteller.
4. Adhering to a philosophy of standardized enterprise systems and the business processes they support. Much has been written in the past for the need for global corporations to implement standard enterprise systems—ERP, CRM, supply chain management, and HR. Yet far too many companies still use a mishmash of enterprise packages or even contort software from the same company in order to please local interests. This is a huge impediment to rapidly integrating IT in a merger. It is much easier to integrate the enterprise systems of a company with a standard Oracle or SAP system than it is to merge five to ten flavors of those systems.
Being prepared for the M&A marathon requires companies to harmonize their own enterprise systems, to fall back on one standard in each business process. Standardizing the way data is collected and formatted, and the way business processes are run, will also go a long way to make integration easier. This also makes documenting and benchmarking your operations far easier. For example, if you have only one sales planning system, and the same version of it across your company, it is much easier to document its performance. With different flavors of the system, or (to be sure) ten different packages altogether, the complexities of evaluating and integrating them just went up by a factor of ten.
5. Maintaining a narrow integration focus. A large company can have dozens, even hundreds, of business processes and supporting information systems. But rest assured that they all do not have the same value in keeping customers happy and competitors at bay. Companies that announce shortly after a merger that they will benchmark 100 or more business processes and systems across two organizations are asking for mountains of trouble. That work will require dozens or hundreds of analysts, months of time and lots of money.
Moreover, only a few processes truly matter to a company’s marketplace performance. The pricing system of the aforementioned airline company, for example, is what distinguished its financial performance, as well as its customer service. In most companies, 70% to 80% of their processes and systems are commodities—infrastructure that does not distinguish the company. Only 20% to 30% are core to competitive differentiation. During a merger, both parties need to focus their integration efforts on that 20% to 30%.
Being prepared for the M&A marathon requires companies to harmonize their own enterprise systems.
Going back to the airline example, had the acquiring firm focused only on the pricing systems at the outset, it would have had more time to determine whose systems should prevail. But it did not focus on pricing—it evaluated dozens of systems and processes concurrently. The result was a hasty decision that led to choosing the wrong pricing system. The lesson—decide which of your processes and systems are in the core 20% to 30% that really matter, then spend 70% to 80% of your time deciding on how to integrate them.
6. Embracing M&A as a fact of life and continuous M&A improvement as a core competency. Many executives regard the time spent to make a merger work as a negative experience. But for many companies, especially those in mature and fast-consolidating markets, M&A is unavoidable. In these firms, the mindset must change—M&A is a necessity to keep them competitive. At the global chemical company mentioned earlier, the CIO and his boss recognized the firm had to make a near steady stream of acquisitions and divestitures. That helped their staffs view their M&A activities as a positive and a competence they had to keep improving. That leads to the second point here. After your company has established its M&A center of excellence, it cannot sit back and let that knowledge become static. The world of information technology changes more quickly than most imagine. Better technologies emerge, requiring a fresh look at how they can help a company market, sell, and manufacture its offerings, new business process and IT skills are required, and companies now have many more options in building IT-intensive capabilities. For example, many companies still do not understand the growing capabilities of public clouds as they are still pondering how many servers and other IT infrastructure they will need for their computing workload. More of such infrastructure is becoming available outside your data center. If you are basing your technology budget on an on-premises model, it is likely to become outdated at some point.
Only the Highly Prepared Win the M&A Race
Experienced marathoners train for race day. After the race is over, they soon begin preparing for the next marathon. Companies that make M&A a key growth strategy need to take the same approach. They need to prepare rigorously for the day when they buy another company and hope to reap the substantial benefits from streamlining their IT-intensive operations. Companies that rise up to this challenge will have a powerful advantage in a world driven by scale and cost advantages.

27,"Mike Olson abhors the term artificial intelligence. As co-founder and chief strategy officer of Cloudera, he has seen first-hand the advances that computers have made in recent years. But they are not, he believes, intelligent yet, in any meaningful sense.
Founded in 2008, Cloudera is the first provider and supporter of Apache Hadoop for enterprises. They have experienced hyper-growth as a business on the back of an explosion in big data of their customers. With funding of $670 million to date and 1,200 employees worldwide, Cloudera offers customers open source software that handles the thorniest big data challenges, from storage to analysis.
Artificial intelligence (AI), says Olson, is an inaccurate descriptor. We still do not know enough about how human intelligence works to replicate it artificially any time soon. For another, AI conjures up scary images of the eerily sentient HAL 9000, from 2001: A Space Odyssey, or autonomous Terminators making creative, spur-of-the-moment decisions, to execute their program of human destruction. Thankfully, machines like those remain in the realm of science-fiction.
“I am not worried that the Matrix is going to wake up one day and decide to eliminate humanity,” Olson says.
What Olson is witnessing instead is the rapid development of machines capable of learning—perhaps to a lesser extent than AI promises, but enough to hold out great and real possibilities right now for enterprises and for us.
“The computer algorithms we’re building now are really good in the narrow domains in which they work, but they are not human in character,” Olson explains. They are not generalists, as we are. Companies can teach a neural network to recognize faces—often better than a human can. But the machine will be face-specific; it will not recognize a pizza.
“These are special purpose-algorithms trained on a specific set of input data, great at noticing patterns, and great at recognizing those patterns in new data,” Olson says. Over time, these systems advance within their domains. “These machines do ingest data and use the data to build models on which they make predictions,” he explains. “And the more data you show them, the better they are at doing that. In that sense, they are learning.”
Olson predicts that these learning engines will proliferate rapidly. “We are going to be surrounded by these agents that are good at very narrow, predictive applications. And rather than some massive, global, artificial intelligence developing, we are going to be surrounded by special-purpose systems that we interact with on a day-by-day basis. That is going to be a huge change in the way that we work.”
Organizations have had the ability to teach computers for decades by inputting data. But only recently have they had the large volumes of data, huge compute capabilities, and real-time analytics platforms that are necessary for these systems to teach themselves. “Now, at places like Google, Facebook, and elsewhere, those systems are easy and cheap to get,” says Olson. “The result is that these relatively mature algorithms are suddenly effective in ways they never were before.”
Machine learning is proving very powerful in industries as varied as healthcare, finance, energy, and retail. Cloudera uses machine learning to predict when its own customers’ computing clusters may be about to experience a problem, and then the company solves it for them before they ever have to call customer service. One Cloudera customer, a U.S. financial regulatory authority, uses machine learning to look at complex patterns in trading to spot illegal collusion between banks. Electronic medical records company Cerner is working with Cloudera on algorithms that can notify hospitals when a patient is likely to become septic. This system has already saved hundreds of lives.
“We have gotten really good at deploying these algorithms against specific problems and getting shockingly good results,” Olson says. “Computers now are better at vision than people. If you have got a diagnostic image or an x-ray, you would actually rather have a computer look at it and give the doctor its interpretation than rely on a human radiologist who may be tired, or may simply miss something.”
Olson believes it is critical for Cloudera, now an established tech player, to continue to explore the many technologies emerging around machine learning. He worries that companies often fail to recognize or properly value disruptive innovations because they are focused on protecting their existing business models.
These companies, says Olson, “are operating at the very peak of their markets, and emerging technologies that look to be of lower value, but solve different kinds of problems, are consistently missed.”
As Cloudera’s chief strategy officer, Olson does not need a machine to recognize that pattern, nor an artificial intelligence to tell him about its risks. So he plans to keep his eyes wide open and focused on the future.

28,"TCS: What are the key ways in which manufacturing companies have simplified their business models in the past few years?
Milind Lakkad: Several distinct models are visible in the marketplace, the first on the product side. Companies have dramatically reduced the total cost of managing multiple products, for example in the car industry, by designing platforms that they apply across models. This lets companies simplify product lines as well as supply chains. Supplier consolidation and harmonization of components contributes significantly towards this effort. Similarly, in the customer-facing areas of sales and services, companies have made it significantly easier for customers to do business with them by integrating all potential touch points. Offering a complete range of parts and services online, with customer-friendly self-service options, reduces the total cost of conducting business and enhances customer satisfaction. Changes like these bring manufacturers closer to the ideal paradigm of ‘design anywhere, build anywhere, and sell anywhere’.
TCS: How are manufacturing companies lightening the business model and generating new revenue streams by solving additional customer problems?
Lakkad: New age technology is enabling manufacturers to explore and exploit new business models. Two examples come to mind. The first, a large industrial power equipment manufacturer, seeks to generate services revenue secured via long-term contracts, by offering what matters most to its customers—equipment up-time. By monitoring and predicting the behavior of the installed equipment, using cloud-based big data analytics, the company heads off equipment problems for customers and quickly addresses any issues. These exclusive services are offered at a premium.
Elsewhere a diversified manufacturing firm has started its journey to become a ‘software-centric enterprise,’ by monetizing insights gleaned from data that resides on its products in the field. These insights can be shared with the customer for performance enhancements, for example, tuning airplane engine performance for specific, and dynamic, flying conditions in order to save on fuel costs. The manufacturer takes a share of the savings accrued.
TCS: What stands in the way of further simplification of business models for manufacturing companies?
Lakkad: Companies face both internal and external barriers while adopting simpler business models. From an internal perspective, years of capital-intensive investments limit a company’s ability to exit current business models and embrace new ones. Manufacturing companies typically carry over significant costs from the past. Nevertheless, companies are trying various ‘CapEx to OpEx’ models, including contract manufacturing, divestitures, and the like.
From an external perspective, joint venture and merger and acquisition deals, which are frequent in the industry, can create new barriers as companies strive to harmonize business operations. Ambitious ‘convergence’ initiatives, designed to harness the core strengths of both organizations, will fail without strong executive sponsorship and strategic focus. Whether a company faces internal or external barriers, managing change across a diverse workforce poses its own challenges.
TCS: How different will a typical manufacturing company’s business model look five years from now?
Lakkad: The advent of the Internet of Things changes the picture significantly, enabling the production of smart, connected products that let manufacturers be in touch with customers throughout the entire life of the product. First let us look at business model change driven by this phenomenon. Connected products let the manufacturer disintermediate the channel and transform from being a business-to-business (B2B) player to a business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) player. This paradigm shift allows manufacturers to work on new business models, especially around services. For years, distributors and intermediaries captured the services revenue, while the manufacturer capitalized only on the sale of the asset. Now the manufacturer can gain annuity revenue from services, which also cushions against cyclical business downturns. In five years, one can expect the manufacturing business model to be a mix of diversified services businesses, driven by a software-enabled enterprise.
The other big model shift is the concept of ‘extended mobility’ driven by connected cars. The emergence of the shared car concept is creating a new business model, which will require auto manufacturers to establish new ways to engage customers. In five years, we would not be surprised to see a significant portfolio of auto manufacturer revenues coming from this new channel, which a few years ago was unimaginable.

29,"Companies today must get smarter, faster, and lighter at ever-increasing speed. This challenge will weigh most heavily on top management at big organizations, both at the corporate and divisional levels. They risk making their firms, and themselves, obsolete if they cannot learn new business models, new strategies, and new ways to organize work—even new ways of thinking—more quickly than in the past. The half-life of business knowledge is quickly diminishing—accelerated by game-changing technologies that enable companies to transform themselves quickly as the world changes.
Last year, when asked about the most important trait of a successful leader, General Electric CEO, Jeff Immelt, answered that it is the ability to learn new things. “You need to be a learner,” he told Fortune magazine. “If you want to be successful, you have got to have an antenna up all the time, and you have got to be open to new ideas. You have got to be grabbing every new thought you can come up with. And you can never feel like you are safe in anything you do.” That is why GE spends $1 billion every year on education and training.1
It is also why other companies are now upping their commitments to more regularly updating the mindsets of their top people. Executives who believe their biggest learning days are in the past will be in for a rude awakening, as an increasing number of leading academics, business magazines, and CEOs like Immelt are saying.
So how must executive learning change to keep executives and their companies competitive? It needs to go beyond developing the skills that are relatively timeless: project management, personal communications, time management, etc. It also requires a clear understanding of the current shape of the business, the future trends that will reshape it, and most importantly, executives’ ability to challenge and change how they think.
2.3 billion consumers today actively use social media and 2.1 billion use smartphones
Before examining how executive learning needs to change, let us first look at why today’s prevailing business wisdom will not have the shelf life of the wisdom that preceded it.
The Rapidly Declining Half-Life of Business Knowledge
Many companies today are under unprecedented pressure to become smarter, faster, and lighter. However, if senior executives operate under obsolete notions about how to achieve those goals, their initiatives will fall short. They could even fail altogether.
How so? Consider the world of consumer products marketing. Given that 2.3 billion consumers2 today actively use social media and 2.1 billion use smartphones,3 marketing strategies and tactics have undergone a sea of change. Renowned global brand builders such as Procter & Gamble, Nestle, and Unilever have dramatically altered the ways they create awareness and demand in the last 10 years. They, and other big consumer firms, have deep partnerships with companies that were not around at the turn of the 21st century (or were in their infancy): Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Alibaba, to name just a few.
Just consider how fast the world of Nestle’s senior marketers has evolved. In investor presentations today, the $87 billion food, water, and chocolates giant uses terms that would have mystified both Wall Street and Madison Avenue in the 1990s: ‘global mobile app consumer engagement platform’, ‘end-to-end eContent lifecycle’, and ‘digital acceleration team’, to name a few.4 In fact, $3 billion of Nestle’s business in 2015 came from selling directly to consumers online, a business whose revenue has grown an average 16% annually since 2011.5
Business functions outside of marketing could tell a similar story of rampant alterations in the ways they work, especially customer service, R&D, and sales. The cost to a company of a top management team that operates with an outdated picture of the world can be severe.
Yet it is perfectly understandable how it happens: the world is shifting under executives’ feet far faster than ever, but some do not feel it.
Yet the signs are everywhere. Here are three of the most significant ones:
Percentage of companies on Fortune 500 list that disappeared

The shrinking fortunes of very big companies.


      
We all know that thousands of small companies disappear every year. But even the biggest companies are succumbing, or at least falling off their lofty perches, faster. Between 1995 and 2015, 57% of the companies on the Fortune 500 list disappeared, up from 45% that fell off the 1955 list by 1975. What might make even more than 57% disappear by 2036? The acceleration of technology. In a 2015 survey, the magazine asked Fortune 500 CEOs about their companies’ biggest challenges. They rated the rapid pace of technological change as No. 1. What is more, 94% said that in the next five years, their firms would change even more than they had in the last five years.6 Why do so many large companies lose their way? They lose touch with the world around them.
 2. An explosion of better ideas about how to run a business. 

Articles published in academic journals
 

Number of academic periodicals
 


So many more ideas are out there today about how to optimize a business, especially ideas based on academic research. Unlike less tangible signs of tumult, this one is easier to measure. The total number of articles published in academic journals jumped 85% between 2003 and 2013, from 1.3 million to 2.4 million.7 In the last 30 years, the number of academic periodicals (including business) has more than doubled, from 95,000 in 1985 to over 230,000 a year ago.8 More knowledge means more theories and more approaches to how businesses should work, how diseases should be addressed, how social issues should be tackled, and so forth. With so many more competing ideas about how business should be conducted, it is becoming much easier to be guided by obsolete concepts.
3.Far-reaching changes in virtually every profession.

Percent of advertising dollars spent online, 1995–2018 (projected)
 




You only have to look at marketing to see how prevailing practices are becoming obsolete faster in every business domain. Twenty years ago, internet advertising was largely a foreign concept. Print and broadcast media were where chief marketing officers and their advertising agencies spent the marketing dollars. Fast-forward to 2015, and that picture changes drastically. Online advertising (seen on desktop and mobile devices) commands 29% of the global advertising pie, and is projected to snare 38% by 2018. If that happens, the Internet will top TV as the largest advertising medium. Advertising executives who think they are still largely in a Mad Men world of print campaigns and TV jingles should think again.9 In many ways, the world has changed even faster in fields such as IT, manufacturing, research & development, and customer service.
Along with these three signs, many other signs tell us that a great deal of today’s business knowledge is not likely to be right next year or the year after. But whether you believe them or not, many companies have already acted as if they are a fact of life.
Over the past three decades, the data shows that companies—worrying that their executives’ knowledge may go the way of the dinosaur—have built their own places of higher education. In 1985, only 18 U.S. companies had corporate universities, or places where they could educate employees and develop skills. General Motors was among the first of these, developing its in-house program in 1920. By the 1970s others had followed suit, such as Fiat. By 1997, that number grew to 1,000, and then it doubled again to about 2,000 by 2007. Today, an estimated 4,000 companies around the world have their own formal universities.10

Companies that are not building college campus-type buildings are sending their executives off to accredited business schools in large numbers. To meet the voracious demand for executive education programs, more business schools are offering them. The percentage of business schools worldwide with non-degree executive education programs has risen steadily, from 34% in 2003 to 44% in 2013.11
All of this demonstrates that companies are worried their executive teams may be operating under outdated beliefs about their markets, customers, competitors, and how to do business. The worries are valid. It is natural for highly successful executives at highly successful companies to rest on their laurels and believe they have all the answers.
Bill Taylor, co-founder of Fast Company magazine and author of the new book ‘Simply Brilliant: How Great Organizations Do Ordinary Things in Extraordinary Ways,’ explains it this way: “Why is it so hard to make deep-seated, meaningful, long-lasting change in long-successful companies? The longer you have been in a discipline and the higher up the ranks you go … it becomes hard to open your eyes and minds to new ways of solving longstanding problems. … It takes a real act of leadership willpower to make sure that what you know does not limit what you can imagine.”12
As Taylor believes, “leaders should take a gut check to understand whether they are learning as fast as the world is changing.”
FIVE WAYS IN WHICH EXECUTIVE LEARNING NEEDS TO CHANGE
Is your team that fast? And, if not, how can you help them stay current with the fundamental changes in the way your industry, customers, and competitors operate? First, help them understand that learning does not end after graduation or after a promotion to the C-suite. In fact, one could argue that learning today must be accelerated for those people who are shaping the destiny of a large company.
Here is some other advice based on the practices of companies that are ahead in the game of keeping executive worldviews current:

Get the best educators from the best sources. Companies such as Unilever, Apple, and GE sought out prominent business school professors to lead their executive education initiatives. Unilever went to professors at business schools such as Cambridge University, INSEAD and others to design and teach the programs on its two campuses (one in London, the other in Singapore). Apple hired the dean of Yale’s business school (Joel Podolny) to run its little-publicized executive learning program, Apple University.13 Getting the very best experts in each field will mean cherry-picking them from multiple institutions, not just one.

Make the learning immediately applicable, not theoretical so executives use the new insights right away. The corporate university at German airline Lufthansa continually revises its curriculum so that it is in line with the company’s strategy.14

Create education that is irresistible—and not optional. Continual learning is no longer a luxury that executives can do when they ‘find the time’. But consider highlighting the carrot rather than the stick. Executives should know that a growing body of leadership research ties ‘the ability to learn’ to ‘promotion potential’. For example, research from executive recruiter Korn Ferry has found that people with high learning agility get promoted much faster—twice as many promotions over 10 years as managers with low learning agility.1Learning agility refers to someone’s interest and ability to grow from experience and use that learning to succeed in a new experience.

Make learning illuminating, not dreary. Executives have short attention spans. They also have day jobs. It is hard for them to learn often radical-sounding ideas about the business and their area of expertise if the course content is arcane, boring and not visual (i.e., mostly text). What is more, it needs to be presented in shorter, more digestible chunks. Expecting executives to learn about the A to Z of digital strategy in six months of courses is unrealistic. That learning, at the least, needs to come in smaller but highly informative and highly useful pieces. Overall, corporate educators must make sure the learning content passes the ‘wow’ test: Does it make sense? Is it interesting? Does it provoke? And does it instruct on what to do next?

Ensure it’s convenient. If executives are to continually learn important new things about their field, the education must be highly accessible. Expecting managers to go offsite or even just into the next building for days or weeks at a time is not realistic. The rapid rise of online learning—so-called Massive Open Online Courses—shows it is indeed possible to educate executive’s right at their desks or on their smartphones. More corporate education has to be delivered that way, rather than at a monthly visit to the corporate training facility.


As digital competition continues to force established companies to re-think their business models and how they operate, they will have to treat executive learning as a necessity, not a luxury. Doing so will increase their ability to win at the now-perpetual game of getting smarter, faster, and lighter.

30,"The push for agility in software development started nearly 20 years ago. But today, with technology becoming essential to the way business is delivered, agility in the IT function alone is not enough.
To make much faster changes in their product, service offerings, and the business processes that support them, companies need to implement agile principles and approaches throughout the enterprise. Enterprise agility encompasses all components of an enterprise’s design and management: its strategy, people, processes, technology, and infrastructure. The goal is to deliver what customers want, and to continuously adapt to market and customer changes.
As with all transformations, this is a tall order. It involves altering the DNA of the organization, and how it senses and responds to the marketplace. Asking every function in a large organization to adopt agile principles all at once is a huge undertaking likely to produce both false starts, occasional resistance, and cynicism.
This is the holistic challenge of embracing enterprise agility to create a flexible, adaptable, responsive, and more competitively fit organization.
Achieving enterprise agility takes commitment. It means investing in people skills, in new tools and technology, and in a workplace organized to encourage teamwork.
It requires making the organization’s culture flatter. It calls for adjusting decision-making styles, including the speed at which people make them. It means spending time and resources on change management to sustain these new ways of working.
The effort pays off. Enterprise agility improves collaboration. It leads to a higher quality of products and services delivered. It speeds time to market for those offerings. It improves processes for creating demand (through marketing, sales, and R&D) and for generating supply (through production and distribution). It strengthens customer service. It boosts productivity.
And the need for enterprise agility is clear. Established companies are learning that digital startups have three distinct advantages that enable them to make rapid inroads into markets once ruled by incumbents. These digital natives:

Do not have to compete on the same terms, with the same strategies, business processes, and legacy systems as incumbents to pursue market opportunities. (For example, to compete with taxi services, Uber and Lyft do not have to maintain a fleet of vehicles.)

Can develop digital systems far more rapidly, using testing, and data from customer trials to ensure a higher likelihood of success. (Consider Amazon’s continual adjustments to its web store offerings.)

Typically develop these digital systems rapidly using lean-agile approaches (as do Airbnb, Spotify, and Google, among others) rather than traditional, sequential, time-consuming waterfall project management.


While the business urgency to create an agile enterprise is clear, it’s unrealistic to ask every executive running every business function to adopt agile approaches immediately. Eventually, organizations that wish to compete in a digital world will have to embrace agile as a new way of working, but because the transition is a significant shift in how business process and product managers operate, and what they value, asking them to do so at once is likely to be met with resistance.

Figure 1: Differences Between Traditional and Lean-Agile Organizations
A better approach to an enterprise’s agile transformation begins with a tight focus on a core set of activities within a business function, making those activities agile, and then demonstrating their benefits to the rest of the organization—and then replicating that work elsewhere to scale it across the organization. We call this embracing agile at the core of value generation for the enterprise, and using success to enable change to ripple across until it transforms the entire business.
The road to any large endeavor begins with a thoughtful assessment to determine where to begin.
Where to Begin
Deciding which part of an enterprise to make agile first should start with an agile readiness assessment to identify the business area best positioned to adopt agile practices. This area will become the agile pilot for the enterprise. And as agility depends upon a foundation that makes it possible to develop and test new products and services iteratively and quickly, this determination should start with an examination of the existing ways in which people are organized, the culture in which they work, and the processes, technologies, and tools they use to accomplish that work.  

Figure 2: Examples of Companies That Have Embedded Agile in Their Business
Figure 1 provides a simplified view. It includes characteristics in place that describe a traditional organization (or functions within an organization) before it adopts lean-agile principles, along with the characteristics that describe organizations and functions after they have adopted them.
A critical consideration in discussing how enterprises become agile is noting that it is not an all-at-once proposition. Figure 2 shows how companies have incorporated agile techniques in parts of their businesses to meet specific business needs.
Performing an agility assessment calls for analyzing the organization’s work activities and separating them into two categories:
Pattern A applies to the parts of the organization working on software development, maintenance, and operations. This includes areas such as IT, operations, and quality assurance testing. These IT-centric functions are poised to adopt lean-agile principles as well as agile methods and practices. By lean and agile principles, we use the terms outlined in the Scaled Agile Framework:4

Respect for people and culture, in which people perform work to benefit customers;

‘Flow’, describing how teams achieve optimized work processes to create continuous and sustainable value;

Innovation, in which producers create new products for customers to validate;

A focus on relentless improvement.


Agile methods include scrum (in which the product owner works with team members to identify priorities for development), sprints (periods lasting a set period of time in which the team develops minimally viable products to test), and stand-up meetings (daily, or regular team meetings to get fast status updates).
While in most organizations it’s common for Pattern A activities to occur in IT-centric functions—after all, agile began as a software development movement— they can also occur in other functions. Some companies will find these activities in sales (such as with a customer app), or in HR (if recruiting is central to that company’s business model).
Pattern B applies to business functions such as strategy and planning, marketing, finance, HR, R&D, learning and development, and others. These functions are well suited to adopt lean-agile principles, but not necessarily all agile methods. The adoption of agile methods and practices should be reviewed for their applicability and real benefits, as opposed to force-fitting agile to proven business processes.
Selecting an Agile Pilot Project
The next step after identifying the area of a company to make agile is selecting a pilot project. An ideal pilot project should be neither too short (to be credible and representative) nor too long (so the company can see timely outcomes and benefits). We typically recommend three-month pilots, giving the company sufficient time to inspect, adapt, and adopt lessons after four or more iterations during the project.
The pilot project should matter to the larger organization—but not be a top priority. Top priority projects will place too much pressure on a project team engaged in what is also a learning exercise. On the other hand, unimportant projects will not gain adequate commitment by participants, and will fail to establish credibility for lean-agile approaches.
A successful pilot project provides proof that lean-agile practices are valuable. It demonstrates to leaders and the organization that they can execute an agile project in the company’s core. With a successful pilot complete, it’s time to build on that experience.

Figure 3: Scaling Agility Across the Enterprise
Spreading Lean-Agile Practices to Other Areas
The decision to bring the benefits of lean-agile practices to other areas of the company typically requires choosing between two paths. To spread agile approaches across an enterprise, companies either can scale lean-agile practices vertically within a business unit or horizontally across business units.
Vertical scaling within a business unit calls for adopting lean and agile practices using proven frameworks. Scaling methods such as the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), and Disciplined Agile Delivery (DaD) are all well-established examples of frameworks that companies can follow to promote and propagate lean-agile practices and methods. For example, a retailer could first adopt agile for its portfolio of merchandising products in a particular value stream (the steps required to make goods for available for sale, and then sell them). Next, it would adopt agile methods and practices for supply chain products related to the same value stream.
Horizontal scaling would follow a similar pattern by emulating the successful experience in the company’s core in a different business unit, bringing lean-agile practices to the new functional area. For example, a company could begin in its development organization, and then bring lean-agile principles to operations, and later to customer service.
Whether scaling horizontally or vertically, success factors include:

Creating a competency pool within the organization using a construct such as an agile center of excellence where talented staff can practice agile principles and methods, and be available to work on subsequent projects. This can help a company disseminate agile approaches effectively.



Business support. The goal of spreading lean-agile practices throughout the enterprise is nothing less than a thorough transformation. In our experience, agile enterprise transformation succeeds best when the business drives changes, and IT works as an equal partner.



Building cross-functional, agile teams with people possessing the authority to drive change. Cross-functional knowledge will help the team to spread agile ways of working when the company moves from a pilot project in one area to adopting agile ways of working in another. This team will create clarity for stakeholders, defining both the roles they play, and the work they do.


To initiate the journey to spread agility to other parts of the organization, start by using the agile readiness assessment to identify areas for improvement that are well positioned to adopt the new practices. Then prepare a transformation roadmap, for second, third, and more projects, and functional areas. Organize teams around value streams in the business area so the team’s work is focused on projects valuable to customers (whether external or internal). Invest in coaching to help teams learn lean-agile practices and methods.
During projects, inspect results and adapt accordingly. Review progress according to relevant business metrics. Track outcomes. Conduct regular retrospectives to identify project areas that met or exceeded their goals, and those that could be improved. Correct course and adapt as required to meet the company’s objectives.
Results from the Field
The examples of two companies that disseminated lean-agile principles across their organizations illustrate the kinds of benefits others can expect.
Example 1: A large Australian energy company
Problem: Challenges included new energy options like solar and wind, stiff competition from new market players and new energy regulations giving customers more choice in providers.
Solution: The energy company adopted agile across the enterprise with the goal of reducing time to market for new products to support frequently changing business priorities. It increased its capability to develop fit-for-purpose solutions to compete in its market, and prepared for a major digital transformation.
Driven by its CEO and CIO, the company’s initiative reorganized business and IT based on customer experience value streams. The company established capacity-based agile teams with a ‘core and flex’ model (core team members were helped by people with right skills added as needed). It made investments to improve collaboration, including redesigning the work floor, and strengthening the technology infrastructure to support distributed agile teams. It automated software development and operations activities using DevOps practices.
Results: The company achieved a 90% reduction in deployment time for software products, a 40% reduction in production incidents that could lead to disruptions, and faster resolutions of application problems, leading to higher customer loyalty.
Example 2: A large U.S. retailer
Problem: Traditional project delivery methods were unable to meet business expectations for quality and timeliness. Functional silos dominated. Too many interdependencies among applications meant that software products depended on other software products to work—making them unreliable and inefficient.
Solution: Reorganized the enterprise, transforming it into a business portfolio-based product organization. It switched to agile and Scaled Agile Framework delivery methods across all business lines. A technology refresh included infrastructure upgrades that supported automation, including DevOps. New work spaces were created to improve collaboration and agility for business stakeholders and development teams.
Results: The retailer saw an eight-fold increase in annual product deployments. New product features reached the market 40% faster than before. Production problems fell by 20%. IT costs dropped by 20%. And IT infrastructure improvements led to a 95% reduction in lead times needed for providing required resources.
Time for an Agile Enterprise
Lean-agile is a proven approach being adopted by all types of enterprises. For companies facing new competition, especially from non-traditional, digitally native companies, not pursuing lean-agile is not an option.
When starting this journey, draw the vision for agility at an enterprise level. Every company is unique, so, where to start and how to scale will be different for everyone. But prioritizing the need for speed is always the same. Then experiment, learn, and adapt.
And do not look for perfection; do not fear failure. In agile terms, failure is an opportunity to learn, refine, and improve the organization, and the result. Fail quickly. Learn. And then go fast.

31,"While it is very beneficial to have all the team members of small agile teams co-located, insisting on having all inter-related agile teams in the same location is not worth the effort and is unrealistic in today’s global business environment. In fact, in the last article of this issue of Perspectives (“Why Your Agile Team is Better Off Dispersed: The Case for Location-Independent Agile”), TCS makes the case that agile programs whose teams are distributed can more quickly develop new processes and systems that are more on target with customer needs.
In our own work, we have observed several hundred projects that use location-independent agile teams. Given the challenges involved, it is clear that one way of working does not fit all projects.
For example, some projects may be best suited to having agile teams co-located, at least at first, while others may succeed best with contributions from different agile teams in many places. Companies that are new to agile approaches can also benefit from starting with co-located teams as they work to build distributed capabilities. Which model a company chooses will depend on a variety of factors, including the business knowledge needed and where it resides, whether the work is urgent or has non-negotiable constraints, and the maturity of the organization’s agile development processes.
There are three aspects to successfully implementing location-independent agile teams:

Assess the organization’s distribution of business expertise, the nature of work, and agile maturity.

Choose the right agile working model to meet the organization’s needs.

Continuously improve the agile capabilities of the teams to gain the benefits of location-independent agile.


First: Assess the Organization
Use the three criteria referenced above to determine the organization’s capabilities for location-independent work. Answer these questions:

What is the level of business expertise and other skills required, and to what extent do they exist at a specific location? If a location lacks business expertise, it will require more of it to be able to support agile teams there. As team members accumulate experience, they will build business knowledge, making them both more valuable, and more able to work as part of a distributed organization.

How urgent and volatile is the work? At first, location-independent agile teams should focus on work that is neither urgent nor volatile. If the work is both, if it has non-negotiable constraints (such as overnight fixes, intra-day scope changes, or regulatory requirements), or if there is a need for constant access to the project owner, it’s best to work with teams in the same location, if at all possible.

How mature is the organization? When teams are relatively new to agile approaches, team members should be co-located. Having a common understanding of agile culture, especially among the leadership, indicates the organization can succeed with location-independent teams.


Having a clear understanding of the organization’s starting point will point leaders to select the best approach for moving forward.
Second: Choose the Right Location Model
We have identified four potential models for organizing agile teams, ranging from teams that should start in the same location to those that can be effective in a highly-distributed arrangement (see Figure 1). Descriptions of the models follow:
Local (Model 1)
This model is best when the teams are new to the business area, when continuous access to a product owner is paramount, or when regulatory concerns require the project to be executed in a specific geography. However, when a project or program is ready to scale up, enterprises will need to consider evolving to one of the other models.
Minimally Distributed (Model 2)
The product owner and a few members of a project or program are located together as one team, while the rest of them work together as another inter-related team in a different place. This model requires the teams to understand the underlying business processes for their product. They will still need frequent access to the product owner and infrastructure teams for business decisions and infrastructure privileges.
When it’s time to expand the project or program, enterprises using the Minimally Distributed model will need to adopt one of the remaining two models for quick on-boarding of talent in additional locations.
Location-Independent Agile Model

Figure 1: Four Models of Location-Independent Agile
Significantly Distributed (Model 3)
The product owner and few members of a project or program team are located together as one team, while other teams working with them reside in multiple locations. Enterprises that have already distributed teams with a shared understanding of the business processes of a project or program are well positioned to adopt significantly distributed agile work processes. This model not only offers the scale for enterprises to deliver large programs as well as frequent releases by increasing their access to the right talent, it also provides for business continuity.
Fully Distributed (Model 4)
The product owner may be at any site, while the rest of the project or program team members are grouped in agile teams across distributed locations. These teams each include product specialists with sufficient business knowledge to drive day-to- day decisions within a framework defined by the product owner.
A Fully Distributed model is useful when enterprises need to empower teams with independent decision-making capability, such as when business experts do not have enough bandwidth to drive product leadership on a daily basis.
We have observed that many organizations experience dramatic benefits after successfully deploying one of these four location-independent agile models. For example:

Location-independence makes an enterprise more agile. Using the minimally distributed model (Model 2), a large U.S. retailer with a delivery team of 1,500+ members in India reduced its IT operations costs by 20% and improved end customer satisfaction by 40% in 18 months. These benefits resulted from a combination of steps, including role rationalization, product re- architecting, and the application of DevOps practices for automating new product deployment. (DevOps is an approach to IT software development and operations that emphasizes automation to speed up software building, testing, and installation.)



Location-independence makes an enterprise more productive. By using all 24 hours available to execute work in parallel across time zones, an organization can accomplish more in the same time than co-located teams that are limited by an eight-hour work day. Leveraging 24-hour, five- days-a-week development coverage with significantly distributed (Model 3) teams across U.S., India, and Mexico, a large financial company was able to cut the time it took to introduce new products to market by 78%.


By sharing skills across multiple teams in different locations, companies can accelerate work without requiring business experts to participate in daily decision making. One U.S. retailer was able to complete an integrated channel delivery project in just 11 months with fully distributed teams (Model 4) by leveraging the domain skills of product specialists in many locations. While product owners still have to make prioritization decisions and confirm product acceptance, they can delegate significant amounts of knowledge work involved in product development.


Third: Improve the Agile Capabilities of Teams
Organizations that want to move from the Local model to one of the location-independent models can improve their agile capabilities in five ways:
1. Build business knowledge-oriented teams at distributed locations. Consistently seek to optimize each team’s product and business expertise by promoting the team structure around business concepts. A U.S. retailer was able to move from a fully co-located model to a minimally distributed model in three months by relocating some experienced team members with business knowledge to another location, and leveraging their expertise to form a new team around this business knowledge.
2. Configure teams to take advantage of time-zone differences. For effective collaboration and communication, agile teams need a minimum overlap across time zones. Calibrate each team’s work hours so that as one team heads home, another team can pick up the work, with enough time for communication to ensure it continues at a steady, sustainable pace, with minimal confusion.
Take the experience of a leading U.S. bank as an example. The bank had one team in Texas, and another in Chennai, India. The teams adjusted their hours to overlap based on how much time they needed to resolve their interdependencies. They became motivated to improve how they worked to reduce the number of overlapping hours they needed.
3. Minimize planning overhead. An Australian retailer synced up the sprints and product releases of its three agile teams, reducing the teams’ planning time by 20%. To achieve such results, it’s critical to automate as much of the teams’ work as possible using DevOps automation and design engineering practices.
4. Create a ‘one team’ culture. Teams across the enterprise should use the same agile practices, same work and infrastructure privileges, and share common work characteristics. Culture coaches can help geographically distributed teams understand and appreciate their cultural differences, ensuring the teams have healthy working relationships.
5. Plan the right distribution of work across locations. Organize the work to minimize dependencies across teams while maximizing workflow. At a European telecom provider, software development teams were originally aligned on horizontal areas such as routers and signal processors. When it created agile teams, it restructured to focus on business features such as customer gateways, thereby reducing dependencies among the horizontal areas and enabling more frequent and value-added product releases.
Overcoming Skills, Process, and IT System Challenges
As the scale of change involved suggests, aligning multiple agile teams located in different time zones and countries is a complex endeavor. Challenges may emerge involving shortages of the right skills, employees’ adapting to new work processes, and a company’s IT infrastructure.
To get the most from location- independent agile teams, an enterprise needs to put people with the right skills in the right places. In addition to universal coaching and training in agile practices, one way to do this is to train team members in more than one skill.
For example, instead of having some team members who are application developers and others who are testers, train some people to be adept at both jobs.
Legacy ways of working, and employee attitudes toward them, can hinder the cultural change needed to pursue agile. Some employees will have trouble adapting. They can benefit from coaching that goes beyond teaching agile techniques to practicing new roles. Hands-on practice will help them understand the benefits of pursuing agile approaches to their own work lives.
One important stumbling block to setting up distributed agile teams is frequently the existing enterprise IT architecture which may not support agile ways of working. The systems that underlie the work of developing and releasing new products must be able to handle increased production loads. For example, if an agile team has to produce a product in two weeks, and the supporting architecture requires more than a two-week lead time to schedule a test, the agile team will fail to meet its deadline and become demotivated. Furthermore, the ripples of that failure will hurt productivity across other teams and degrade the company’s ability to innovate. Leaders should assess the strength of the company’s IT architecture when they start planning for agile adoption to identify the necessary improvements.
Capturing the Benefits of Location-Independent Agile
It is possible to take advantage of distributed agile teams and thereby maximize enterprise productivity and innovation, but companies need to know how to do it correctly.
That means knowing yourself—your business expertise, where it resides—and the level of your agile maturity. It also means determining the right location model for your work—local, minimally, significantly, or fully distributed—based on your business’s needs, goals, capabilities, and the competitive landscape.
As your organization gains experience, you can move up the ladder toward a more fully distributed model. With advancement comes the opportunity to acquire additional benefits from organizational agility, as well as the ability to compete more successfully on a global scale.

32,"Every company we know is in a new era of information technology that has erased industry boundaries, altered competitive dynamics, and ushered in formidable new players. The technology I’m referring to is the convergence of several technologies that have rippled and ripened over the last decade, most notably cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) devices, and the internet itself.
Together they are stirring the pot of industry change faster and faster. The first global sectors to be transformed are those whose entire product could be digitized and delivered digitally (media and entertainment, banking, business information, and more). But even products that must remain physical products, and services that customers must experience at a company’s place of business (hotels, airplanes, etc.), are being digitally altered to become much more useful products and services.
The impact on industries can’t be overstated. ‘The World is Flat’ author and New York Times columnist Tom Friedman so aptly stated this recently1:
We’re in the middle of a change in the ‘climate’ of technology. We’re moving into a world where machines and software can analyze (see patterns that were always hidden before); optimize (tell a plane which altitude to fly each mile to get the best fuel efficiency); prophesize (tell you when your elevator will break and fix it before it does); customize (tailor any product or service for you alone) and digitize and automate just about any job. This is transforming every industry.
While such predictions could be easily dismissed in the past, they can’t be today. The reason is that a growing number of companies are getting rich by using these technologies in these ways. They offer dollars-and-cents proof that the transformation is here. Consider three stunning statistics on the money some firms have already made (or their value in the stock market) by tapping into the cloud, AI, IoT, and other mobile digital devices and the internet:
• $2.4 trillion: The combined market value of Facebook, Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, and Netflix in June.2 All but Netflix deliver their digital services to your digital devices through the cloud (their own data centers). Netflix delivers its video services through Amazon’s cloud, AWS.
• $39 billion: How much revenue investment analysts predict Facebook will produce in 2017.3 (Its 2016 revenue was $27.6 billion.) If it hits that number, Facebook’s revenue will surpass the revenue of the entire U.S. newspaper industry in 2016 ($29.6 billion).4From where does Facebook get that revenue? Since (unlike newspapers) its members can get its content for free, Facebook gets it from advertising that the company can tailor to its members’ needs and tastes. And it is increasingly using AI to target those ads.
• $7 billion: How much revenue General Electric (GE) expected to generate in 2016 from its digital business, which helped the company, customers, and its industry partners capitalize on IoT devices and software. GE predicts the number will be $15 billion by 2020.5
I hope we have begun to convince you (if you weren’t convinced already) that this technological revolution is having substantial here-and-now consequences. The articles we’ve assembled in this issue of Perspectives shed light on why things are playing out this way.
We’ve organized the articles into two sections: the business opportunities of the technological transformation, and how to pursue them. Here is a preview of each article.
The Business Opportunities
Where to Turn AI and Automation Loose in Your Company
Industrial-strength AI is ready for deployment. But one of the biggest challenges for large companies is determining where to use it. Although the possibilities are endless, companies’ budgets, of course, are not. In their article, Ashok Pai and Krishna Mohan give executives a way to identify the best places to use AI in their organizations.
Why Your Products Must Be Smart and Connected
In the last few years, strategy experts like Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter have been urging industrial companies to embed their products with digital sensors and wireless devices that report back on how they’re functioning in the field. In their article, Sreenivas Chakravarti and Anurag Jain argue that making such products smart and connected is no longer an option; it’s a necessity. They explain why virtually every manufacturer should now be using such technologies to turn their products into services.
Now You Can Simulate Nearly Anything
Suppliers of public cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google represent a powerful capability that many companies don’t realize they now have: to simulate strategies, product and service concepts, and new business processes at affordable prices. In their article, PR Krishnan, Satishchandra Doreswamy, and Suranjan Chatterjee explain why this is so important today, and seven applications of simulations that promise big benefits. To illustrate each one, they point to examples at Kellogg, Aon Benfield, GE, and HSBC, among other companies.
How to Pursue the Opportunities
What Happens When You Turn Your Products Into Services
So you’ve decided to make your products ‘smart and connected’. How do you then play in the ‘servitization’ game, the one in which you’ll generate revenue by offering your product as a service? In his article, Regu Ayyaswamy explains why the service opportunities are abundant: They turn what he calls ‘open-loop’ systems into ‘closed-loop’ ones—where a manufacturer no longer loses information to third parties on how its products are performing for customers. He examines four servitization opportunities for companies with closed-loop systems, and explains how to overcome significant obstacles that will stand in the way.
Why Agile Software Development Requires Radical Changes in Budgeting and Scoping
To stay competitive in this world of intelligent cloud-based products and services, big companies need to move as quickly as new companies. That means getting new digital products and processes up in weeks or months, not years. But that can’t be done if such systems are staged, funded, and scoped in the same manner of the enterprise systems of old. Companies must now rely on agile cross-functional teams that use agile software development methods. But that is harder than it sounds, and one of the biggest barriers is how agile programs are scoped and funded. In short, traditional systems budgeting and scoping methods can throw wrenches into the wheels of agile development. In their article, Nidhi Srivastava, Apala Mukherjee, and Somnath Ghosh provide an antidote to the all-too-frequent starts and stops of agile teams: a different way of scoping and budgeting these programs.
Raising Your IoT Cyber Security Game
By making their products smart and connected, manufacturers can transform themselves into service companies and generate new revenue. But they can also generate the attention of attackers to their new IoT-enabled products, as TCS IoT cyber security expert Satish Thiagarajan writes in his article. As he says, hacking incidents into IoT-enabled products in the U.S. alone soared seven times between 2010 and 2015. And most computer networks should expect IoT security breaches next year, warns IDC. Thiagarajan outlines eight steps companies should take today to reduce the chances of becoming the next victim.
The Big Opportunities at the Junction of AI and Analytics: Interview with Tom Davenport
We are delighted to feature an Interview with Tom Davenport, a leading chronicler over the past 30 years on how information technology has radically transformed the work and very essence of large businesses around the world. Since the late 1980s, Davenport has been a pioneer of business process redesign/reengineering, business analytics, and other leading concepts. He has published several classic Harvard Business Review articles and bestselling books on the business value of enterprise systems, knowledge management, big data and analytics, and most recently AI. I think you’ll find Tom’s interview eye-opening, particularly his call for companies to stop focusing on using technology to get rid of people.
Executive Traits for Recognizing the Bountiful Opportunities Ahead
The opportunities we point to in this edition of Perspectives are substantial. But they are also difficult to recognize. In our last article, I look at five personality traits of three of the most successful CEOs of the last 10 years—Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, and Reed Hastings—all of whom were early to recognize the implications of cloud, mobile devices, and AI, and moved their businesses forward early to capitalize on them. I explain how the traits—abundant imagination, a voracious appetite for often-clashing ideas, relentless focus on increasing value to customers, calmness in the face of the rising competitive storm, and being sentimental about top talent but not about their jobs—are so crucial today.
I hope these articles provide you and your colleagues with inspiration and ideas that help your organization thrive in these exciting times.

33,"Threatened by digital competition, many companies are embracing lean-agile approaches to accelerate innovation to remain market relevant and fiscally viable. When companies master them, these approaches become a competitive advantage in harnessing talent and capability, a key tenet of what we call Business 4.0.
Using lean-agile approaches to nurture innovation requires mastering the discipline of generating new ideas and managing the subsequent innovation portfolio based on strategic or other business outcomes sought. It means applying lean-agile precepts not only in those functions directly involved in the development and delivery of products and services to end customers, but also throughout support functions and shared services.
The Meaning of Enterprise Agility
To match the accelerating speed with which their market sectors are changing, companies must take a broader approach to becoming innovative—an approach that we refer to as ‘enterprise agility.’ By that, we mean an organization that can adapt all the core elements of its business—its strategy, product and service offerings, the business processes that create and fulfill demand for those offerings, its people’s skills, and technology and IT infrastructure—at the pace that’s required to stay competitive and solvent. That, in turn, means adopting a lean-agile culture throughout the organization, not just in software development.
While there are three broad dimensions to achieving enterprise agility—strategy and process, people and culture, and tools and technology—in this article, we discuss the elements that are conducive for innovation:

Strategy formulation to guide the organization’s innovation efforts;

Cultural transformation to change values, beliefs, mindset, and behaviors at all levels; and

Focused experimentation to improve everything.


Let’s look at each element.
1. Strategy Formulation
A key step in enterprise agility is outlining a company’s innovation strategy: what it seeks to accomplish through innovation, and how. This strategy requires executives who are aligned, engaged, and committed to innovation. They must communicate consistent messages across the enterprise about the goals, why they matter, and how every employee in every function and group can contribute. Top managers must then encourage the next level of leaders to successively spread, contextualize, and reinforce those same messages in their business units and functional areas.
Strong governance is another element of the innovation foundation. This allows the right distribution of responsibility and accountability, and ensures transparency in decision-making.
We recommend establishing a balanced scorecard that is consistent with the enterprise’s innovation strategy.
By measuring the effectiveness of ongoing activities against a list of strategic goals, a company can focus on efforts that will deliver a continuous pipeline of innovations.
2. Cultural Transformation
But developing and communicating an innovation strategy is not nearly enough. Leaders must give their people the motivation, training, and tools to make it a reality. They must encourage continuous dissatisfaction with the status quo, while rewarding creativity.
Leaders must also develop competencies in lean- agile techniques:

Empowered teams who can develop minimally viable products and services to test with customers, to ‘fail fast’ and learn from iterative attempts.

Systems thinking: focusing on how a system’s parts interrelate, and how that system works within larger systems.

Design thinking: idea-generation and problem-solving that looks at human behavior and needs, in addition to business and technology factors.1


Leaders who commit to the lean-agile approach must also commit to rethinking where they surface ideas for improvements everywhere, including those for new products and services. Such leaders will also create an entrepreneurial work environment that extends to the edges of the company—outside (those that touch customers) and inside (those that support those who touch customers).
The following is what a snapshot of that environment looks like:
Outside edge. Here, an agile enterprise empowers frontline people who interact directly with customers, including employees in customer services, sales and delivery, to discover unfilled customer needs. For example, it could be an idea for a new product or service offering, or a better way to deliver that product or service.
Inside edge. This is about support functions such as HR, finance, legal, and procurement working to improve the ways they help their customer-facing colleagues. This means rethinking traditional ways of working that rely on narrowly defined specialized roles, predictable scope, pre-defined timelines, budgets and staffing. New thinking—about improving existing systems and service—will enable faster responses not only to the internal customers, but will improve the organization’s ability to serve external customers.
For example, think of a traditional contracting process with fixed terms. If a new type of customer service option requires a more flexible scope with few pre-defined requirements, adaptive procurement, and legal functions will be poised to make that a reality faster than before.
By adopting lean-agile ways of working where innovation is an everyday phenomenon, the people at the outside and inside edges of an agile enterprise will be able to create and implement new ideas more rapidly.
Yet it takes more than people and ideas. It also requires lots of agile experimentation. Two internal TCS information systems (a collaboration platform and a digital learning system) are good examples. Our company needed to enable training and development to go beyond the classroom, so that employees could be located anywhere, and learn at their own pace. Teams working on the systems used both design thinking and agile development practices to collect and evaluate ideas, and apply constraints (such as information security policies, scalability at the enterprise level, and technical debt.2) They used agile development methods to sharpen ideas and create prototypes. They used DevOps to push minimally viable products into production so that end users could test them and provide feedback quickly.
The results: Fresco Talk, the collaboration platform, grew quickly to 60,000.TCS employees without an in-house marketing campaign before spreading out across the company globally. The digital learning platform, called Fresco Play, went through fine-tuning with end users in the real world business environment before it was rolled out to 400,000 employees.
Forward-looking companies are also collaborating outside of their corporate walls to harvest innovative ideas from their ecosystem partners. A leading U.S. audio equipment manufacturer and a major toy maker are each tapping partners (such as TCS) to generate new product ideas through a structured ideation process. The two companies then flesh out the most promising ideas and test them with business stakeholders before they enter product development cycles.
3. Focused Experimentation
As the initiatives above show, leaders must set up a system to vet incoming ideas for market relevancy and technical and financial practicality, by testing and improving them with feedback from customers (or, customers’ proxies, such as market experts or customer service representatives, when actual end- customers are not ideal evaluators for confidentiality or competitive reasons).
An approach we have seen work is the Rapid Iterative Experimentation Process (RIEP). See Figure 1. With RIEP, a company sets up a system to evaluate incoming ideas by applying criteria consistent with its innovation goals. It builds a portfolio of the best ideas that, in light of corporate strategy and market conditions, balances risk and opportunity. It can perform experiments to determine which ideas are well suited for market introduction, and then bring the best products and services into production.
The experimentation stage embodies the lean-agile approach and is particularly important. It is a rapid, iterative process of solution prototyping, concept simulation, and testing to validate ideas along multiple dimensions. This process will quickly and cost effectively prove or disprove critical hypotheses about an idea’s customer attractiveness, market viability, and technical feasibility. It gives internal investors (for example, the CEO and business unit heads) the information they need to more confidently make decisions to pivot, halt, or continue with ideas in the portfolio.
Figure 1: Rapid Iterative Experimentation Process
Large companies practicing RIEP often start with a centralized group—some call it an innovation lab or design studio or agile studio—to perform the experiments. In smaller firms such as startups, the culture demands an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ approach where likely everyone is involved.
Enterprise Agility at Work
Empowering people on the edges of your business to see and experiment with new concepts has been a key ingredient to the rise of some of the most successful digital companies: Facebook, Amazon, and others.
Take Facebook. “You’d be surprised by how much of the product roadmap over time is set, not by us talking about what we think we should do and deciding, but by engineers coming with ideas,” said co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.3 Facebook stages regular hackathons in which its engineers develop initial prototypes of new products and product features. These have led to some of its best offerings—Chat, Live, and the platform on which developers make games. Hackathons have also led to its first video player.4
Amazon also promotes a culture of experimentation at the front lines. Says Lean Startup author Eric Ries: “I know examples where a random Amazon engineer mentions, ‘Hey, I read about an idea in a blog post. We should do that.’ The next thing he knows, the engineer is being asked to pitch it to the executive committee. [CEO] Jeff Bezos decides on the spot.”5
When Sun Life Financial opened its fourth innovation lab near its Toronto headquarters in 2017, the 153-year-old financial services company cited its ability to bring agile teams together to meet, not just with each other, but also with area startups to exchange ideas. The innovation labs have elevated Sun Life’s ability to connect with customers, something which Alice Thomas, chief digital technology officer, said is emblematic of the company’s digital transformation. “It’s adapting to how clients want to engage with us,” she said.6
No Time to Lose
Now is the time to develop enterprise agility. Many companies face imminent threats from the changing business environment, with crowdsourcing of new ideas, open source technology, and a myriad of service providers with niche skills, products, and services that are readily available via digital channels. They are all seeking connections with your customers.
And it’s no secret why. Innovation at the edge has become a way of life at companies like Google, and Facebook. Established enterprises like Sun Life Financial and many others are actively investing in creating their own agile organizations.
To start, build a culture that puts a premium on creativity. Encourage innovation throughout the organization. Invest in experimentation. As digital competitors accelerate their pace of innovation, established companies must empower their employees at the edge, enabling its front lines to generate innovative ideas, and then put its weight behind the most promising ones.

"
34,"The articles in this issue of Perspectives show that many C-suite leaders say they believe in agile and lean approaches to making their organizations stronger and more responsive to change in the rapidly evolving digital world. However, how they make decisions (often through a classic multi-level hierarchy), delegate the skills they value most in others, and deal with failures from below is antithetical to making their organizations more responsive to change. In other words, many senior leaders have not adopted the right mindsets and behaviors to help their organizations become more agile.
For example, a global manufacturer organized an agile work team to spearhead a $50 million project to create a single global ordering system. The goal was two-fold. First, to balance manufacturing loads and output among plants, generating supply chain efficiencies. Second, to reduce redundancies in regional support systems.
The project ran into problems. Making one key decision (how long customers would have to cancel an order) stalled the project for months. The team was afraid to make a wrong and consequential decision across the dozens of countries in which the company operated. So, it kicked the question upstairs to the executive suite. After top management mulled a decision for weeks, it pushed it back down, and told the team to ‘figure it out.’ But the team was reluctant to do so. Work stopped, and a big and important initiative, presumptively using agile approaches to get its work done, ground to a halt.
This scenario is not at all unusual among large companies that try to master lean-agile approaches to implementing new, digitally-enabled business processes. The work of the best agile teams can slow to a crawl when senior executives aren’t able to change the way they lead.
It’s one thing to train employees on agile and lean processes and tools; it’s another to change:

The way leaders make decisions and empower team leaders

How leaders communicate organizational goals, and how they react to success and failure

The hierarchy leaders establish to control resources and manage results


Unless leaders adopt agile mindsets to manage agile teams, they can create obstacles instead of facilitating the agile approaches to developing new products, services, and processes that all businesses need today.
What It Takes to Change Leadership Mindsets
Changing leadership mindsets and behaviors requires effort. Leaders in established companies typically have achieved their position based on their experience, expertise, and skills. It’s common for them to sit atop a pyramid-style hierarchy. At the top, leaders are accustomed to making decisions to be carried out by those below them. As they manage from above, a ‘frozen middle’ layer—the people who work between the very top executives and the front-line employees—typically play it safe. Fearing failure, these middle managers resist innovative ideas and new perspectives.1

Figure 1: Changing Leadership Styles for Agile Organizations
Lean-agile approaches call for the opposite decision-making style. In agile, teams organized around a product or issue make the decisions. Organizations made up of multiple agile teams are capable of quick, mid-course adjustments that enable the organization to sense and respond to customers and market stimuli. Teams experiment with solutions, learn from mistakes and improve with all subsequent iterations.
For enterprises moving to lean-agile styles of leadership, individual leaders will have to bridge the gap between old styles and new. This will require training—coaching for the leaders who must empower teams to succeed—and the leaders’ personal commitment to make these changes.
Teaching Successful Leaders How to be Agile
Leaders are central to building and sustaining a lean-agile culture. Because many leaders have risen in a traditional hierarchy, they will exhibit behaviors that have made them successful in the past even as the organization commits to change its way of working. Changing those behaviors is challenging, and the reason why coaching is so important.
Coaching begins by assessing an individual’s current leadership style and how that style can work in a lean-agile environment. It then helps a leader adopt new behaviors—new tools for engaging teams, empowering them to make decisions, and do their best work. Coaches help leaders who are accustomed to command-and-control, top-down decision-making, and adopting a lean-agile mindset.
Effective coaches tailor their teaching to an individual’s leadership style and behaviors, holding a mirror up to a leader so she can see both what she is doing and her impact on others. Does she instill fear or trust in team members? Does she possess the emotional intelligence required to take every team member’s personal concerns and points of view into account as she communicates the team’s priorities? Surveys show low employee engagement across the board. Gallup’s 2017 survey found only a third of U.S. employees engaged at work.2 This is why so-called soft skills are critical.
Coaching sessions make a leader aware of what he does now that can either enhance or inhibit the adoption of an agile culture. Often, behaviors learned over years working (and flourishing) in traditional cultures don’t translate to an agile environment. Agile organizations are flatter, with lower-level people authorized to make decisions. For some leaders, it takes practice (and confidence) to learn how to engage with those employees and cede to them the control they are accustomed to having. Coaching exercises can provide opportunities for these leaders to understand what it takes to invest the time and effort required to develop the personal relationships with team members that allow leaders to engage effectively, and thereby empower team members to succeed in agile ways of working.
The effort to adopt an agile mindset requires building trust throughout the organization, starting with leaders. Examples of trust include:

Showing confidence in teams to make decisions
Understanding failure as a learning
opportunity rather than a reason to assign blame
Cultivating individual relationships with colleagues and appreciating their value (instead of fostering a superior-underling dynamic as in traditional work cultures)

The Commitment Required to Change
Adopting an agile leadership style first requires a program that builds awareness among both leaders and teams that the organization is changing. It’s important to seek buy-in, or informed consent from both leaders and teams that they not only agree to adopt an agile approach, but they also will engage in discussions to understand why they are moving to agile and the challenges they will confront.
Next, organizations often bring in experienced teachers to guide the transition. A leader going through this process can benefit from an outside perspective to help her envision what she will need to do. The transition to an agile culture takes time—typically more than a year to complete—and it affects all aspects of the organization.
The third element involves learning about agile methodologies, and a leader’s role in supporting the teams implementing them. Again, the differences between traditional and agile ways of working are vivid. In agile approaches, teams typically deliver value in small increments, rather than in big chunks. Governance models allow for visibility into the process as team members communicate continuously about the group’s activities, progress, and challenges—and adapt based on needs that change regularly. Agile teams require strong backing from executive sponsors who make it possible to recruit people from across the organization as needed, including a product owner from the business to lead a team, ensuring it has the right number of people as well as the right tools, and a working environment that will allow them to deliver the products the enterprise needs.
Lessons from Leaders at Amazon and Facebook
Companies like Amazon and Facebook, which began as startups and have profited from an agile culture, provide lessons about empowering teams to do their best work. Leaders at these organizations are doing more than removing obstacles in the way of teams trying to do great work. They are leading by example.
To maintain Amazon’s startup culture, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos promotes ‘high quality and high velocity decisions.’3 This includes recognizing and correcting poor choices quickly, and adopting a strategy he calls ‘disagree and commit’: supporting a team’s decision if the members believe in the choice even if he doesn’t. For example, Bezos approved an Amazon Studios production even though he had doubts about it. “Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment,” he writes.
These decisions go in more than one direction. Amazon Studios is not afraid to fail fast by canceling new shows. It canceled ‘The Last Tycoon’ two weeks after releasing a season’s worth of episodes.4 This approach embodies agile thinking. To avoid complacency, Bezos remains obsessed with keeping his company thinking that it’s always ‘Day 1’ of business.
Facebook’s flat organizational structure and acceptance of failure to improve is another example of the lean-agile mindset. “You have to embrace organizational failure,” COO Sheryl Sandberg says. This goes hand in hand with making sure top executives are not driving every decision; everyone feels their input is welcomed and encouraged.5
Sandberg also emphasizes the role that empathy plays in leadership at Facebook. She says she believes in team members bringing their ‘whole selves’ to work, acknowledging that employees have personal lives they bring to their jobs. “It means we are there for each other, we are flexible with what people need, and then we can form the relationships that create collective resilience.”6
Such examples show that leaders can serve their organizations best by empowering their teams, and, as companies like Amazon and Facebook demonstrate, scale, and growth, are not obstacles to maintaining a lean-agile culture.
Agility is About People
Embracing agility is about more than technology. It is about people.
As companies and leaders embrace agile methods, it’s imperative for them to invest in their people and organizational cultures, not just in the technology stack, or in agile development and delivery of DevOps to automate technical capabilities. That investment is important because succeeding in creating a lean-agile organization requires changing how decisions are made, the way teams are formed, and the way they work together.
Embracing agility also calls for changing how organizations measure and recognize teams and leaders. That means establishing incentives and rewards for teams, not just individuals. And it means measuring the success of leaders based on how they help others grow.
Indeed, embracing agility is about creating a more equal ecosystem. Rather than an organization built around departments or groups or functions that become silos, agile requires every stakeholder to contribute value to the whole organization. It calls for each individual to see that value and their purpose beyond any one function or department.
When done well, the people in an agile organization see their work in a team as meaningful, and their organization’s work as making a positive difference for its customers, and, ideally, the world.

35,"Retail CEOs now have the memo. Yes, Amazon was the No. 1 online retailer in the United States in 2017, with $94.7 billion in online sales, almost 20% more than in 2016. Yes, Amazon acquired the Whole Foods high-end healthy foods supermarket chain, thus expanding its reach into brick-and- mortar retail. For retailers, confronting competition from digital-first enterprises is like the proverbial drinking from the fire hose: more than they can handle. Retail CEOs also know these challenges require digital transformations that make their companies faster at innovating, introducing new processes, products, services, and marketing campaigns. And they also realize it’s about optimizing their store and online operations, and being more adept at experimenting with new business models.
Retail leaders also understand that their companies’ technology problems have become customer pain points. Consumers can see if a store’s online prices differ from those in-store. If a mobile payment option isn’t available or isn’t working, customers may go elsewhere. If a personalization algorithm offers mismatched products or services, customers will be disappointed. In this environment, it is critical to address problems as they occur. And that requires them to be agile and adaptive.
However, introducing agile approaches into their business—a proven means for speeding efforts to innovate and compete—is difficult. But it is no longer an option. Realizing this, several retailers worldwide are on an end-to-end value chain transformation to become agile, digital enterprises.
The Reluctant Agilists
While there is great enthusiasm across the retail industry for agile adoption, there is also great resistance— frequently from functional managers fearful of losing authority, and from leaders reluctant to flatten their organizations—exacerbated by an industry-wide unfamiliarity with agile fundamentals.
We have seen some retailers attempting partial adoptions of the agile approach—what we call ‘proxy agile’. They do this by slicing existing projects into smaller projects, hoping to gain speed. The IT organization’s ways of working may change, but the business decision- makers do not. These projects retain the overall scale of traditional ‘waterfall’ software development projects and thus cannot respond quickly to (or even collect) customer feedback. Nor can they test and release products rapidly enough. As a result, they fail to help retailers make rapid innovations.
Breaking Through the Barriers
Agile calls for sweeping changes in deep-rooted ways of working. It starts with leadership. Used to a command-and-control management structure and its associated behaviors, the C-suite has a propensity to attribute the barriers to agile to ‘somewhere down there’ within the organization. Instead top executives need to be ready to model the following behaviors:

Values-based leadership

People empowerment and distributed leadership

Test and learn leadership

Product leadership

Partnership and engagement among business and technology experts


Agile leadership also demands empowering change agents in agile teams, and providing support so they can drive transformation.
This work is not easy. Here are seven ways retail organizations can overcome the most common barriers to agile adoption:
1. Espouse strong leadership commitment.
Paying lip service to agile is not sufficient; the CEO, and all top-level executives, must be committed and engaged. This commitment begins with education: engaging coaches and trainers who can teach business stakeholders the principles of agile, and conduct exercises to practice and inculcate its collaborative and inclusive methodology. All business leaders should understand and internalize both the need for change and the essence of the agile approach. They must assume product ownership, including responsibility for defining the product roadmap and instituting short feedback loops to learn from and act on end-user feedback.
2. Create a transformation blueprint.
The CEO must also recruit his or her executives to work with technologists to identify how to serve customers better, prioritizing initiatives that provide the most value for all stakeholders. This group must create a transformation blueprint to help leaders understand what the company will look like after agile adoption, how it will operate, and what their roles and duties will be.
3. Establish communities of practice (CoPs).
The company should set up communities of practice to drive agile adoption and motivate cultural change. When the agile transformation is under way, the CoPs should provide governance for the effort, and metrics to produce evidence of benefits such as improved customer satisfaction scores or faster time to market for new products and processes—especially improvements in the software development lifecycle.
4. Replace traditional ways of scoping projects with value-driven scoping and budgeting.
The old ways of organizing, staffing, budgeting, and planning projects must be replaced with value stream- based funding. Retailers should launch high-value, low- cost initiatives first, and delegate scoping and budgeting to agile delivery teams. We recommend following a quarterly cycle for portfolio demand planning, discovery, prioritization, and funding to enable delivery based on business value.
5. Adopt intelligent automation.
Agile approaches to delivering new services won’t work without embracing the automation of IT systems. This means adopting a machine-first delivery model, with DevOps automating the work of engineering and operations for software building, testing, and product introductions.
Retailers also must invest in building capabilities for AI- driven automation of engineering processes to enable fast and frequent delivery of customer products and services, while reducing development overhead. One of the most interesting areas of AI is seeing how the technology can be used to improve estimates. AI is well placed to provide agile teams guidance on decisions in which there is a complex interplay between different variables and a lot of data available from previous projects.
6. Manage organizational change.
Project managers and application developers accustomed to the waterfall method are used to having months to plan, and a year to build a new product, while their bosses call the shots on features and scope. The agile approach flips that, with the team making those decisions and working on short projects in iterative bursts. This can be disconcerting. Every team member should understand the organization’s current state of operations (as well as its competitive position), why the change is necessary, how it will happen, and what it will take to make it successful. This strategy helps ameliorate the all-too-human fear of change while addressing future uncertainties.
Ongoing communications and coaching is essential. A communications channel such as a mobile app can help answer any questions on the transformation journey and share information at appropriate milestones. Mechanisms must be set up for experience gathering and knowledge management. A learning academy can offer advice, instruction, and support. Such programs will enable agile team members to work closely with agile coaches, scrum masters, product owners, and the engineering and operations teams to design just-in-time interventions. These interventions can be designed as experiential learning through case studies, scenarios, and performance aids based on an analysis of the organization’s performance.
7. Measure the progress.
Organizations must develop a framework to assess the impact of changes and choose the right communication strategy for measuring progress and delivering feedback. Establishing a change agent network for each business area by work function and by geographic location will support the ongoing effort to drive change management associated with adopting agile. Providing a dashboard view for the organization is crucial to frequently assess the progress of the agile transformation journey. Evangelize success stories and discuss lessons learned for quick adoption of needed adjustments.
Cruising Down the Agile Stream
Agile approaches do not prescribe a standard operating model. Organizations must determine what specific capabilities are relevant in their customer context and experiment (people, process, technology, and operating model) by using pilot projects and fine-tuning their approach.
The best way to introduce agile techniques is to eliminate large waterfall projects immediately, and replace them with work designed to be accomplished quickly.
When that work is tested with customers and they react positively, project managers and developers begin to see the benefits of receiving immediate feedback. They will warm to their task—especially if their efforts are reinforced and rewarded by management. Although this may sound straightforward, in practice it requires time, patience, and persistence.
An anecdote from our experience shows that leaders can make an important difference. We recall being at an executive meeting with a retailer’s functional heads, who were striving to become more agile. After a presentation and discussion on what an agile transformation required, the head of store operations stood up to volunteer that his group be the first to adopt agile. It turned out that company wanted to relaunch a new mobile application for store associates, and the executive wanted to provide his staff members with capabilities to do their jobs better. While stores are typically the most challenging environments in which to introduce agile, this executive saw the urgency of the need to change and seized the chance.
The Benefits of Agile Adoption
When it comes to agile adoption, two major questions surface in boardrooms: How can agile really help? What difference does it make if our enterprise becomes “fast”?
The experiences of several leading retailers that have transformed themselves into digital-first enterprises offer answers. A digital-first enterprise is product-centric. It is a technology-led organization that relies on automated systems. It invests in a modern architecture and takes advantage of cloud computing.
Becoming digital-first has helped several retailers create a unique and differentiated customer proposition. It enables them to make intelligent decisions and quick adjustments empowered by customer feedback, thus increasing their organizations’ resilience in the rapidly evolving retail environment.
In addition, agile development methods have helped them adopt new business capabilities quickly like expanding their product lines, offering new fulfilling methods, convenient payment options, and an interconnected customer experience. Agile methods also enable intelligent decision making. These retailers have harmonized their mobile apps, websites, and stores to provide a seamless, consistent experience for customers who switch between devices and modalities. Figure 1 provides snapshot examples of what leading retailers can achieve by becoming agile.
Retailers are using different strategies for beefing up their digital portfolios.

Figure 1: The Benefits of Being Faster, Examples from Leading Retailers
Agile Retail: It All Starts at the Top
Agility at the enterprise level is about applying the principles and values of agileto create an organization level ecosystem that embraces and supports agile. All the departments including support teams such as Marketing, Sales, Finance, and Administration start espousing a ‘by default agile’ mindset. Cultivating such a digital, agile environment requires strong commitment from the leadership team. They must make the transformation their top priority, and define, lead, and communicate the transformation.
At the end of the transformation, organizations will have a blended team of business and technology managers who are highly productive in driving on demand capability releases on a resilient technology platform that responds to any system glitch.
Agile retailers not only serve their customers better, they are better able to compete with emergent digital natives, with a chance to win. This makes the effort worth it.

36,"Few stories better illustrate the challenge facing banks and financial services firms than the swift rise of Quicken Loans and its online Rocket Mortgage unit. Quicken Loans used Rocket Mortgage’s 2016 launch to increase its loan volume by more than 7% to $96 billion. Rocket alone closed $7 billion in loans in its first year, immediately placing it among the top 30 U.S. mortgage lenders.1 Quicken Loans, meanwhile, increased its U.S. mortgage market share six-fold over the last 10 years, from less than 1% to 5.7% in 2017.2
How did Rocket propel Quicken Loans? The parent company’s CEO credits it to embracing agile approaches in which “the entire team works towards the common goal of making life radically simple for our clients through innovation and passion”3
But the mortgage business is by no means the only financial services segment in which companies have adopted agile techniques to blow by competitors. FinTechs and startups, sometimes working with established financial services firms, have made real inroads in all banking products, services, and markets. Take the example of Vantiv. Now merged with Worldpay, the U.S. based payment processor has used agile processes to become a global payments-processing leader in 146 countries, handling $1.5 trillion in transactions per year.4
Agile adopters such as online-only U.S. banks like MovenBank and AllyBank boast about offering competitive financial products and a better customer experience than many of their brick-and-mortar brethren. Online wealth management firms like iQuantifi are using robo-advisers and algorithms to provide financial advice to clients. Digital mortgage lending platform provider Roostify has partnered with JPMorgan Chase to let home-buyers track loan applications online.5 6
Mobile payment platforms also represent a threat to the banking and financial services industry. AliPay, the digital wallet operated by Alibaba offshoot Ant Financial, boasts 520 million Chinese customers representing 51% of China’s $11 trillion internet payment market, and the company is expanding outside China.7 Its rival, WeChat Pay, linked to the WeChat message service offered by Tencent, accounted for 40% of that market in 20168 and has moved into Malaysia.9 Both services’ mobile payment volumes dwarf totals logged in the U.S. Mobile payments also have driven growth at PayPal, whose latest quarterly profit rose 32% rise in its most recent quarterly report, powered in part by Venmo, the company’s social payment platform, and by partnerships with big banks like JPMorgan Chase, as well as tech titans like Google, Apple, and Facebook.10
Those digital-first giants provide their own challenges, as researchers expect Apple, Facebook, and Google to drive growth in payments through their customers’ smartphones11. Mobile devices have given consumers powerful tools for conducting a universe of financial transactions, and they expect their banks (like their stores and governments) to work ‘anytime, anywhere,’ like their favorite apps.
While banking leaders understand the need to adopt agile approaches to counter such disruptive competition, their existing processes, systems, and organizational structures stand in the way of adoption. Even some with agile teams still take months to do what nimbler competitors do in days or weeks.
Banks and financial institutions that wish to compete with truly agile organizations all face the same question: Can we become agile enough, fast enough?
The Missing Link: Unprecedented Cross-Functional Collaboration
Executives at large banks and financial services companies run into familiar problems trying to deploy agile teams and scaling agile across the enterprise. While each institution takes an approach best suited to its context, the lack of a common vision (‘Why agile?’) and what it means to adopt the agile ‘way of working’ leads to many failing to deliver the business value they anticipated.
These institutions run multiple lines of business, with organizational structures and processes to support each one.
But these structures and processes typically create distance between marketing, research, legal, and other participants in agile teams. Instead of collaboration, there are hand-offs: the marketing team hands off a decision to the finance team, and the finance team adds information and hands the decision off to the IT team to develop a solution. This adds time and static to the development and launch of new financial products.
The IT landscape at big banks is another major barrier to agility. Over time, through mergers, acquisitions, and other changes, their systems have become complex and unwieldy. Implementing a simple feature in a customer engagement system, for example, requires difficult integration work, and iterative testing to make sure the new feature works well with other features and doesn’t break them. In addition, there typically is little automation available to test and release software. In this environment, agile teams inevitably confront bottlenecks and grow frustrated.
These problems share a common theme: Business and IT managers must work continuously together to bring new products from conception to market. If they don’t, agile methodologies will never achieve the speed for which they were created. Agile won’t work without a unity of purpose, a one-team approach.
In short, becoming an agile organization calls for a transformation that engages people, systems, and processes at all levels. Agile is not just about creating software.
Coming Together Around Agile
To overcome the impediments to becoming agile, financial services companies must take three paths:
1. Organizational assessment and planning.
They need to define their vision, identify the internal impediments to agility, and create an enterprise transformation roadmap to overcome them. This is about having a change management strategy, adequately supported with resources. Any systemic change requires a feedback mechanism to collect and analyze stakeholder reactions. Addressing the feedback is what drives progress.
2. Implementation preparations.
The goal of agile transformation is to create customer value quickly. Therefore, companies should establish teams organized around discrete pieces of the customer experience. Those teams will work best when managers demonstrate ‘servant leadership’—i.e., acting frequently to remove impediments that can slow the work of digital product teams, rather than operating in a traditional command-and-control mode.
3. Technology platform and engineering culture.
To support the agile deployment of new products, financial services firms need to employ modern IT architectures and designs, like micro-services and application programming interfaces (APIs) that take advantage of the latest technology infrastructure designs, and cloud-based systems. What’s more, product engineers must adopt a culture of automated systems— converting manual technology work into automated work wherever possible.
Empowered Teams are at the Center of the Action
Self-organizing teams staffed with people from all relevant functions are the heart of an agile organization. They, not their superiors, must be allowed to decide what they can deliver—in weeks, not months—based on the resources they have.
These teams have the power to make these decisions because they are backed by the business’s leaders. That only happens when everyone in the C-suite understands and visibly demonstrates (through daily attendance at team meetings if need be) that agile adoption is necessary to the organization’s future.
Why do all CXOs need to be on board? Because only they can give teams the flexibility to define the scope of their work and prioritize goals based on the business value their products deliver to customers. Banks succeed with agile adoption when they have business- IT teams in which members share ownership of the work: the delivery of new functions to customers.
A company’s technology foundation also is critical to optimizing agile teams. Leading practitioners of agile methodologies adopt DevOps strategies that automatically release new features after the team develops them. DevOps empowers a company to collect timely feedback from customers about new digital products.
That feedback enables teams to quickly improve the product, the customer experience or both.
Building the Team: How to Do it Right
Agile teams must possess all the required skills for assessing customer needs and developing new products and product features. As such team members must include representatives from all functions that impact the customer experience— i.e., marketing, sales, finance, HR, IT, research, operations, and other groups.
Four other principles are crucial to the success of these agile teams:
           1. Organizing teams by features.
Any team should focus on customer journeys, mapping, and improving a consumer’s experience at every step of his or her interaction with the bank. For example, a team could work to make the loan origination process more efficient. Team members would examine every step in the workflow, from routing documents to how consumers upload them online to ensure requirements (consumer credit histories, loan eligibility, bank account validation, employment, and property value check) are met as seamlessly and effortlessly as possible.
We have seen agile teams cut days from this process by eliminating activities that don’t add value. For example, in the mortgage lending process, customers can provide electronic signatures for documents instead of coming into the bank, a move that saves time, and reduces mistakes. Electronic systems to check an applicant’s credit history and other changes have trimmed six or seven days from the loan approval process, meeting customers’ desires for a faster, easier-to-use process.
2. Develop team skills for analyzing and improving customer value streams.
Team members must be able to dissect what information and expertise are necessary to improve key customer processes. That requires cross-functional teams that can ask questions such as:

What are the key elements and business processes central to the bank’s operations?

How many handoffs are happening between systems and functions?

What tasks add value—and don’t (and thus could be eliminated)?


Mapping a customer process such as ‘from inquiry to cash’ will shine a light on ways to improve workflows and eliminate waste. However, the team working on that process must be composed of members from all the functions that impact that process.
3. Scale those agile skills.
Banks that want to adopt agile approaches are wise to start small— even with one team—before going big.
However, once a bank makes one agile team successful, the goal should be to create many more agile teams across the organization. That will help it to build a culture of rapid, iterative, and customer-responsive change.
When that happens, banks will have a flatter organization in which middle managers can move from a command- and-control mindset to servant leadership, assisting teams instead of running them.
All this requires extensive training and coaching by agile experts. Team members must master agile approaches, as well as their roles on the team. Managers must be trained how to shift their style from supervising subordinates to empowering them. Work areas need more open spaces and flexible seating arrangements. They will foster greater collaboration and improve team productivity (while also appealing to millennial team members). Tools that help team members collaborate— especially chat applications, document repositories, and project management software—are also instrumental to boosting team productivity.

Figure 1: Banking Features Ripe for Reuse
4. Build once, use many times.
When a team develops a hit feature for customers, the organization should look for other parts of the business that could reuse it. This principle is especially relevant to banking and financial services. Figure 1 shows common examples that we’ve seen of banking features that agile teams are repurposing in their companies.
How Agile Can Pay Off
Banks with agile cultures introduce new products and services much faster. They also are quicker at identifying and making cost reductions. Customer ratings also improve. The impact can be eye-opening:

A U.S.-based financial services company cut the time it took to introduce new features 55% and the time to test them 70%. The cost of product development fell 40%.

A leading U.S. mortgage banking services provider reduced the time it took to roll out new product features by as much as 75%, from an average 3-6 months to 6-8 weeks. What’s more, the percent of customers who used the new features jumped from 50% to 87%. Not surprisingly, the company’s JD Power customer survey ratings rose.

A large global bank deploying a digital channel for consumers who wanted a mobile-first experience cut the cost of customer research by 94% after adopting agile approaches. It also reduced the time it took to execute payments by 60%, and the average time it took customers to open a new brokerage account by 75%.


Success Takes Work: Making Agile Change Stick
Even as financial services company executives recognize the need to adopt agile approaches, generating benefits like those described above won’t be easy. Three challenges routinely emerge: winning over key business stakeholders, organizing geographically dispersed teams, and embracing an agile culture across the enterprise. However, each challenge can be overcome.
Collaboration with business stakeholders. While bringing business and IT people together in agile teams is vital to their success, at some banks decision-makers see both the company’s problems and solutions as belonging to IT. Even when technology is central to addressing an issue, however, agile efforts will fail without participation from business functions.
Success with agile requires cross-functional collaboration and direct participation. Teams should include a role for a business-side participant who serves as team leader or product owner. Team meetings should be frequent, with regular presentations, and product demonstrations to business leaders. Teams must also convince business leaders they must devote time to the effort.
Distributed teams. When a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto in 2001,12 they emphasized the value of face-to- face conversation.13 In today’s business environment—with teams often spread across the globe—that’s not always possible.
Managing this challenge demands emphasizing the close communication required among all team members. Teams can still collaborate over long distances when they skillfully distribute work tasks. They can even hasten progress. This still requires regular meetings and leveraging collaboration tools. It also involves the extensive use of what’s referred to as ‘information radiators’: large charts, physical or digital, to track team member tasks and to communicate and sustain team momentum. This information must be available to all team members, whether or not they work in the same room.
Embracing an agile culture. Culture change is hard. Many managers loath ceding control. To get them to embrace agile, its value must be demonstrated to them. For example, a team can show metrics such as data on customer reactions to minimum viable products (MVPs) and subsequent customer feedback on the iterative improvements to those products.
Skills development is another element of an agile culture. Banks should cross-train team members so they gain additional skills. That will reduce the number of handoffs to other teams, which will increase productivity. We have seen banks train business analysts to perform quality function tasks (such as working on test specifications in addition to product specifications), and developers pick up testing skills, and vice versa.
By working together, team members can also gain ‘T-shaped’ skills. By this, we mean they bring knowledge and experience in a particular area (the vertical bar of the T) and leverage knowledge gained from working with experts in other areas (top of the T).
Agile methodologies embrace ‘fast failures’—flaws in a product or service idea that a team discovers early and then fixes. This makes it possible to show how the early lessons learned from such failures can save time and money later as compared to traditional approaches.
There are likely to be some in the organization who resist the effort to move to agile. To bring detractors on board, leaders can implement a comprehensive change management strategy—building awareness, cultivating participants’ acceptance, and enabling them to understand the benefits (‘what’s in it for me’).
Demonstrating quick results from the effort will help win over colleagues who are skeptical of agile.
The message needs to be this: The company’s competitiveness depends on it.
Once these barriers are overcome, it should become obvious that the adoption of agile is making the organization stronger. Agile should be breaking down barriers across the organization, and focusing it on what matters most to customers—and not on products or product features that aren’t generating value. And combined with DevOps practices that automate the release of new technology-enabled features, agile can bring more coherence to a bank’s effort to develop IT systems that were not integrated from past mergers and acquisitions.
Leaders at banks and financial services companies know that innovative, fintechs are working hard to take their business, and they are agile for a reason. Agile approaches are critical to making established financial services firms grow faster, become more competitive, and serve customers better, especially online.

37,"When the signatories of the ‘Agile Manifesto’ spelled out a new way to develop software in 2001, the sixth of their 12 guiding principles was having agile team members work in the same room. “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to, and within, a development team is face-to-face conversation,” the authors said.1
But 17 years later, this is not only impractical for many initiatives, it has become a big liability. Letting agile team members work from different locations is now a must. And it is one that a growing number of companies are proving to be both paramount and possible.
What other companies have found is that having agile team members operate from different sites gives them three advantages in digital transformation: skills, knowledge, and speed. In this article, I will explain why location-independent agile teams can beat agile teams whose members occupy the same room, and thus why companies must be prepared to make their agile initiatives location-independent.
Ignoring the 6th Principle: Most Agile Teams are Already Location-Independent
It’s not hard to see why the authors of the Agile Manifesto urged companies to create agile teams that work in the same room. The ability to have face-to-face conversations on demand can increase trust, accelerate decisions, and spawn better ideas.
It’s a key reason why online music company Spotify has grown from zero to $5 billion in annual revenue since it launched its streaming service in 2008, and 39% alone between 2016 and 2017.2 With more than 160 million subscribers today to its streaming music services, Spotify (whose legal headquarters is Luxembourg) divides its agile teams into four types: ‘squads’, ‘tribes’, ‘guilds’, and ‘chapters’. Each squad works out of the same room (with one room devoted to each squad). A squad typically consists of six to seven people who produce the code that’s put into use often daily on the firm’s site for music listeners and music sellers.
Rapidly growing born-digital companies like Spotify are held out as agile exemplars. As two Forrester research analysts Amanda LeClair and Jeffrey S. Hammond stated in a 2017 report, “Co-locating software development teams is the ideal.”3 We certainly understand the sentiment. But it’s outlived its usefulness, as most organizations that use agile methods are now saying. Despite the benefits of co-located teams, several studies have found that the clear majority of those organizations are using remote members in their agile teams:

According to Forrester, only 12% of agile development shops at large companies have 100% co-located teams. The survey was based on 1,867 respondents.4

A VentureOne survey of 3,880 people at mostly North American and European organizations found 86% had agile teams whose members worked at multiple locations.5 The company’s 2015 survey on agile practices found more than twice as many (82%) had location-independent agile teams compared with the number three years earlier (35%).

Scott Ambler + Associates’ survey found 71% of companies had agile team members who worked offsite.6


In our work at global companies, we have observed hundreds of successful location-independent agile projects. One such company is ABN AMRO.7 With five million retail customers, its retail banking business is one of the top three in the Netherlands. From 2013 to this day, the bank has progressively embraced agile approaches to developing new digital banking services. Since then, the time it takes to test and build new digital offerings has been reduced by 60%. ABN AMRO has also cut by 83% the time it takes to shift new digital services or service updates from production into the marketplace (from 12 to two weeks).
“Our agile way of working now facilitates the quick implementation of ideas,” said ABN AMRO CEO Kees van Dijkhuizen in the bank’s 2017 annual report.8
That’s crucial given all the new digital competition for consumers’ banking business. “Digitalization and changing client behavior is moving far faster than we reckoned,” said van Dijkhuizen. One of the bank’s many digital innovations is a smartphone app called Tikkie. It allows customers to send payments to family or friends through text messages. By January 2018, more than two million ABN AMRO customers were using Tikkie—double the number just six months earlier.9
Since 2016, a U.S. insurance company has dispersed 70% of its previously co-located agile teams to location- independent teams operating in three geographies. Those teams include software developers in offshore locations on the other side of the world.
Three Reasons for Location-Independent Agile
So why are most companies ignoring the Agile Manifesto’s Sixth principle? We believe it comes down to three reasons:
1. They must tap important but rare skills from afar.
Agile teams require skills from multiple disciplines these days: software development, business processes, data science, and more. And, of course, each team needs someone well-versed in agile. (For example, Spotify’s ‘squads’ each have an agile coach.) Many of these skills are in huge demand and short supply. Companies located in areas in which software development and analytics skills are not abundant must bring those people on their agile teams. In many cases, that will mean tapping into them from afar. Yet some companies still tap skills from afar even when they are locally abundant. Consider the immensely popular blog site WordPress, which generates 153 million unique monthly viewers in the U.S. alone. Its parent company (Automattic) is based in San Francisco. Yet nearly all its 699 employees work from their homes in 62 countries.10
2. They need essential knowledge that doesn’t exist locally.
While it’s not easy to separate ‘knowledge’ from ‘skills,’ I consider skills to be the capability a person gains from doing something many times. Knowledge, on the other hand, is possessing information on a topic; those with the most information on it become experts that others go to for advice. For example, I can become highly knowledgeable about the sport of soccer (as many sportswriters are), but never become highly skilled at playing the game (as many sportswriters are as well). In the context of agile, many teams need to tap the brains of experts—not just the skills of other team members. This expertise could be about the messages on an important new user screen (i.e., is it clear and compelling?). Or it could be about deep customer insights that only someone in your firm’s market research department possesses—i.e., the person who conducted the research. Or it could be some other knowledge—i.e., knowledge from people with rare expertise and who don’t have the hours to commit full-time to any agile team. While you may not need this knowledge every day on an agile team, you might need to draw on it frequently. And if you want to draw on it frequently, you are very likely to need these people to share their expertise via web meetings or conference calls.
3. They need to make rapid decisions and not force people to travel to make them.
If you accept the need to have skills and knowledge of professionals from other locales on your agile teams, then you must also accept the fact that you can’t wait for these people to travel to the location of your core agile team before you can make key decisions. That adds days (or even longer) to your schedule. This will especially be the case if you’re drawing on knowledge experts from outside your company—i.e., people whose expertise is in such high demand that they don’t need to travel anywhere to impart it.
Mastering agile demands teams that are self-organized and disciplined, with a razor-sharp focus on goals and daily progress—thus the preference for having team members in one place to facilitate collaboration. Attempts to assemble a team in one location, however, can run into problems. It may be costly to move people, even temporarily, to co-locate them, and not everyone will agree to it.
Leaders are likely to face resistance if they try to force people with domain knowledge from the business side (marketing, finance, HR, etc.) to relocate to wherever the agile team members work. Furthermore, a large organization may have hundreds of agile teams and not enough business experts to assign to all of them.
Agile projects in many companies have grown in size and territory—across offices, states, countries, time zones, and even continents. Many large enterprises have skilled professionals in various disciplines all over the world collaborating to develop online business processes and the underlying systems.

Making the Location-Independent Team Click: Four New Agile Principles
At the risk of sounding like I’m writing my own Agile Manifesto (trust me, I am not), I do want to offer some new agile principles for companies that want their location- independent teams to thrive. These are messages for the leaders of an organization who can play a highly influential role in setting the rules for how globally dispersed, eclectically skilled, and ethnically and culturally diverse people need to work together.

Ensure intellectual harmony. Make sure at the outset that all agile team members understand each other’s domains and terminology, to achieve a common understanding of the terms and manners in which they must work together.

Promote role equality. Ensure unwavering respect for everyone’s expertise (i.e., no caste system).

Protect strongly. Fiercely protect the dispersed agile team from the internal corporate attackers (especially when the investments mount and the returns are still in the future).

Convert widely. Convince skeptical executives to become agile advocates—i.e., why this approach is essential to their and the organization’s success.


Locating all agile team members in the same room has become a well-intended but quaint myth. Instead, companies must create location-independent agile teams: groups working on the same effort not located in the same place. In this way, enterprises can tap the talent needed to innovate and remain competitive wherever it resides in the world, generating more and better ideas for improving digital processes or products.
The biggest reason why most companies are ignoring the sixth principle of the Agile Manifesto is that it no longer makes business sense.
Leaders who understand the severe limitations of forcing people with the skills and knowledge to be in the same room day in and day out are making location-independent agile teams work, and work well.

38,"Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and related technologies were once the realm of science fiction. Fueled by affordable computing power and ample supplies of data, these technologies now have reached the point where they can evaluate options, make decisions, and even take action to execute those decisions.
The opportunities are abundant. Technological improvements in data processing and sensors, coupled with better statistical models and algorithms, have driven recent advances in AI. Sensors nowadays are approaching near-human capabilities when it comes to image processing, voice (and accent) recognition, and sentiment analysis. AI systems today can correlate events, recognize patterns, and derive meaning from the data.
The combined power of these innovations has produced breakthroughs like driverless cars. Established automakers and industry newcomers such as Google, Uber, and Tesla are pouring billions of dollars into creating autonomous vehicles. Toyota alone will invest $1 billion from 2015 to 2020 to introduce AI into its cars and robots in its factories.1
But interest in AI extends far beyond the automotive sector. By that year, the companies surveyed expect that nearly half of the AI investments would be used for transformative change rather than incremental operational improvements.
The 2017 TCS Global Trend Study2 of more than 800 large companies across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America found that 84% companies are using AI already, and 62% see the technology as important to staying competitive in the year 2020.3
Companies noticing these innovations are keen to find ways to bring automation to functions ranging from customer service to risk management to HR. Consumers, who already benefit from AI through the social media sites they use, car ride services, and other smartphone apps, represent another source of big demand.
                             
                                        Figure 1: AI Imitates Human Action to Mimic Human Intelligence
Some companies have already generated big benefits from their AI initiatives. A global information services and publishing company used machine learning to dramatically improve its customers’ ability to derive insights from thousands of legal documents they processed. A leading communication service provider has piloted an AI program to improve its network uptime by deploying a cognitive intelligent platform that combined machine learning, analytics, and robotic automation to predict and prevent network failures.
But even with such AI and automation success stories, most companies we know are not quite sure where to focus their AI investments. As a result, they proceed cautiously, while a distinct minority rushes forward. In 2016, the average annual AI investment among companies surveyed in our trend report was $67 million, but the median spend was only $3 million. Most companies (68%) were using AI to improve their IT operations, especially with the aim of detecting and deterring attempted intrusions into their computer networks and data centers. Significantly smaller percentages of the companies surveyed reported applying AI to their customer service (32%), sales (29%), and marketing (29%) functions. Looking to the future, 70% of the executives expect that by 2020, AI will have the greatest competitive impact outside of IT in functions such as sales, marketing, customer service, and HR.
Our experience shows these executives are not only correct, but that companies in a variety of industries see gains today along a continuum as shown in Figure 1. Market research firms are capitalizing on AI’s image recognition capabilities by using it to collect market data. Data providers use AI to analyze legal documents and identify potential problems. Telecommunications companies apply AI to diagnose network problems. CPG companies use AI to predict and prevent fraudulent invoices. And retailers use AI-powered chatbots to assist customers on internet.
A major airline provides another example. In this industry, on-time performance is a key customer experience indicator and flight delays are a huge concern. While an airline cannot control the weather, reducing the impact of delays and proactively communicating with customers can make a difference. For example, faster insights into upcoming delays can enable an airline to execute more precise schedules for airport gates, ground crews, flight crews, and other personnel.
One major airline used advanced machine learning techniques to build two predictive models—one for flight departure delays and a second for arrival delays—to anticipate whether a flight departing later in the day would take longer than scheduled. The resulting analysis led to a more precise understanding of the reasons (internal and external) for flight delays and the impact of delays on the flight network. The airline was able to improve operational efficiency by adjusting staffing and other resources for anticipated schedule changes, thereby strengthening brand perception.
Figure 1 shows that as AI increases in complexity and capability, it goes from imitating human action to mimicking human intelligence.
As the list of examples grows and as companies experimenting with AI gain experience, the question for both newcomers remains: Where should we begin?
Three AI Traps to Avoid
Before prioritizing their AI investments, executives should be wary about falling into three common traps:

The deep pockets trap. In most companies, the IT department spends the maximum possible on technology. IT departments can make a solid case for using AI to protect data centers and networks, but just because IT has the biggest technology budget, that doesn’t mean that it necessarily deserves the lion’s share of AI investments. In fact, a company might be able to get a greater ROI from targeted AI investments in finance and procurement functions to cut down on fraudulent customer transactions.

The robot trap. Beware the lure of shiny objects. Robots that can clean hotel rooms or answer questions at the front desk are alluring because they have a tangible, physical presence. An AI-powered tool that flags potentially fraudulent customer purchases may not have the same glamour as a robot, but it might have a much bigger benefit to a company’s bottom line.

The pure insights trap. It’s important to remember that AI is just a tool. AI applied to research and analysis can yield all sorts of insights, but executives should make sure that AI-powered research is focused on insights that are useful and applicable to the company’s goals and needs. Connect AI to business value.


Pinpointing Your Company’s Greatest AI Opportunities
Despite AI’s potential to transform products and business processes, executives must not get caught up in the hype. Before they fund AI projects, they need to carefully consider where they can most likely get the greatest positive impact from AI in the organization. In the C-suite, each function head brings a point of view to the question. Chief operating officers typically look to trim costs. Most sales executives we know salivate over using AI to identify the best prospects and win the sale. Many corporate strategists view AI as a way to better understand the changing landscape of competitive moves and customer needs.
The key is to recognize failures quickly, cut your losses, learn from those failures, and make changes to improve the chances of success on future AI projects.
Starting out with AI means developing a sharp focus. For most companies, AI projects will not resemble the multi-year, billion-dollar ‘moon shots’ like the creation of a driverless car in the auto industry. Instead, C-suite executives should prioritize and fund agile, short-term (6 to 12 months) projects backed by a strong business case. Some failures are inevitable. When projects do succeed, companies can expand on those successes by pursuing additional related opportunities.
Figure 2 shows that enterprises typically start with Six Sigma/Lean and task-based automation, and then move towards more advanced stages based on AI.

Figure 2: Maturity Journey of an Intelligent Enterprise
A three-step approach to evaluating automation and AI opportunities can clarify an organization’s best AI opportunities:

Isolate functions that require human intervention. Any task a human currently performs, such as data entry or invoice processing, could theoretically be automated or performed by a system with AI capabilities. For example, a market research firm implemented a system that used machine learning, image recognition, and cognitive intelligence to interpret product images, and automatically capture product attributes to help its consumer packaged goods customers track the competitive marketplace. Instead of having people research and check the images and status of goods for sale, an AI-enabled system automated the process, saving considerable time and cost.

Remove from consideration during the pilot stage those functions that would be too costly to automate now. For example, if a telecommunications provider was exploring its first AI project, it would more likely look to an area like reducing customer churn or improving ARPU (average revenue per user), with proven results in the short term, rather than a multi-year program.

Automate functions with the greatest ROI potential. Companies should look to automate functions that require extensive amounts of manual labor—i.e., an AI system that analyzes insurance claims data and authorizes payments, or a credit card company’s chatbot that communicates online with customers and sends out a replacement card to those who lose their cards. Companies in practically any industry could deploy HR chatbots to answer customer inquiries or collect data from job applicants (saving staff time to schedule final interviews).


The experience of a leading market research organization shows the benefits of a targeted approach. The company used advanced machine learning to automate the process of tracking consumer packaged goods to analyze their performance. The process uses a master product reference repository with a set of defined characteristics in multiple consumer product categories. Because of the volume and complexity of the data involved—there are more than 100,000 items that enter the market in a given month—it can take more than two weeks to code product entries for a few regions.
The company deployed advanced machine learning technology that automated multiple aspects of the process, including comparing existing and new products, predicting prices of goods for sale, and analyzing the text used to define the products. The system deployed an image recognition algorithm adapted to mimic the way the human brain interprets images on product labels. The system, which automates the capture of product metadata, yields faster insights with fewer human interventions, so marketers can respond to market trends more quickly at a lower cost of operations.
How to Evaluate Potential AI and Automation Investments
This process of maximizing benefits from AI projects starts by taking a holistic overview of the company’s strategic priorities and pain points. Consider the competitive landscape and determine where AI or automation can bring the company closer to attaining its strategic priorities. For instance, will AI and automation help the company accelerate time-to-market for its new products and services? Similarly, companies should determine which ‘pain points’, such as inefficient supply chains or poor after-sales service, stand in the way of high performance. Companies need to diagnose the root causes of those problems and should be able to identify which parts of their operations need improvement.

Figure 3: Technical Complexity of AI Implementation and Potential Benefits
As companies identify improvement areas, they can consider which ones lend themselves to automation and digitization. Are the processes predictable and repeatable? Is the IT environment stable or shifting? If the company is in the midst of a multi-stage IT transformation, it can be very complex to attempt to insert automation or AI technology into that precarious context.
Of course, companies should perform a cost-benefit analysis before embarking on any AI or automation project. Based on our experiences of helping companies implement such projects, we know that ROI typically requires balancing expected benefits against the technical complexities of implementation as shown in Figure 3.
To calculate the business benefits of an AI or automation program, companies should consider how many human transactions the new system will replace and the average time it takes to complete a process.
On the cost side, companies must consider the upfront investment of implementing an AI program, maintenance costs, and whether automation will deliver lower costs per transaction or such other savings.
The more judgment required, the higher-order the AI capabilities must be. For instance, a life sciences company trying to automate the process of reviewing reports from doctors, evaluating a drug going through clinical trials, would need a deep understanding of the industry.
Figure 3 shows that companies should assess automation projects based on both their technical complexity and potential business benefits.
Pulling the Right Lever at the Right Time
After identifying promising opportunities to deploy AI or automation technologies, corporate leaders still need to figure out which technology to pursue:
Artificial intelligence represents the highest level of business automation. True AI can sense, think, and act. This type of AI is necessary to power self-driving cars in complex, unpredictable environments. A medical robot might use AI to analyze human vital signs and give advice to doctors about diagnosis and possible treatments.
Cognitive computing systems also can sense and think. In a corporate context, such capabilities can enable people to do their jobs better, improve business processes, and increase profitability. Cognitive computing systems might automate actions people once performed or give people suggestions about their next action. Such systems typically have natural language processing capabilities to collect and analyze large amounts of text, documents, and other forms of unstructured data. For instance, a life sciences company could use such a system to scan records of millions of clinical cases involving its products, detect adverse events, and report them to regulators. Cognitive computing systems generally have machine learning elements that apply algorithms to find patterns in data. For instance, a marketing firm could analyze the consumption patterns of its many consumers. The predictive analytics elements of cognitive computing systems allow companies to analyze data from business processes and find recommended ways to improve results. For example, the system might review a company’s existing process of delivering orders, and then provide recommendations on getting customers their products faster and with fewer errors.
Robotic process automation gives companies a way to apply automation on smaller projects. Chatbots are still new, but they already can respond to customer queries about simple billing questions. Similarly, virtual private assistants make it easier for employees at professional services firms to make travel plans.
Assess Your Situation—Then Move
AI and automation are top-of-mind technologies. Companies around the globe are eager to take advantage of them.
Executives at a leading communication service provider were no different when they approached an opportunity to improve the uptime of their network. Providing superior connectivity depends on efficient functioning of telecom networks. The industry relies on manual identification and resolution of network incidents—caused by technical or environmental problems or human error. It is a time consuming and inefficient process. This service provider sought to improve network uptime and reduce costs while saving time and strengthening service. The project included four sequential phases:

By deploying a cognitive intelligent platform that dynamically combined machine learning, analytics, and robotic automation for network failure prediction, the company was able to automate portions of the network maintenance process.
Like the service provider’s experience shows, incorporating AI into a company’s operations is a tailored fit. Evaluating these opportunities requires a careful and candid assessment of a company’s competitive landscape, its digital maturity, the effectiveness of existing business practices versus industry benchmarks, the potential for improvement, and the complexity of the technological context into which AI and automation would be inserted.
To get the most out of AI and automation, companies need to combine the right automation technology to the right situation at the right time. This process takes time, but there’s no time to wait

39,"It’s become increasingly conceivable and cost effective to embed sensors, wireless communication, and software into all kinds of products—from complex $100,000 industrial machines to $100 thermostats sold on the mass market. Exponential improvements in computing power, advances in sensor miniaturization, and pervasive connectivity have paved the way. It’s a transformation, described by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter and James Heppelmann, CEO of software company PTC, as a move from goods that are simply composed of mechanical and electrical parts to the complex systems we now know as smart, connected products.1
B2B manufacturers of high-cost assets have led the way in this revolution—turning their products into services, or ‘servitizing’ them—with significant results. Schindler no longer simply produces elevators capable of transporting passengers up and down reliably; the company’s technology can analyze and predict elevator demand patterns to reduce elevator wait times by as much as 50%.2 GE has long sold jet engines, locomotives, gas-fired turbines and medical imaging equipment. Today it sells smart, connected versions of the same equipment along with new services built upon the vast amounts of data they generate. The result is a business model that not only sells jet engines, for example, but a ‘full spectrum of performance enhancements across the management of a flight.’3 Farm and construction equipment maker Caterpillar has more than 500,000 connected assets in service, from autonomous mining trucks to tug boats.4
The business value of connecting expensive assets like jet engines and mining equipment—machines that can cost companies millions in revenues if they are out of service or run inefficiently—to the Internet of Things is clear. But embedding sensors and connectivity into lower-value consumer products can deliver significant benefits as well. A number of brands have already introduced smart, connected versions of everyday goods, from home printers that can order their own ink before they run out to refrigerators that can order more milk.
The smart home space is abuzz with developments in automation and control. Even a product as seemingly simple as a toothbrush is getting the smart, connected treatment. Procter & Gamble’s Oral-B Genius pairs a position detection sensor in the brush with a mobile app to help users identify spots they’re missing with their oral hygiene approaches.5 As of February 2016, P&G said it had sold more than 1 million Oral-B SmartSeries toothbrushes worldwide. Yet it called the product merely “the tip of the iceberg.”6
Successful manufacturers of smart, connected products adopt new technologies, including sensors, connectivity and personalization technologies, and smart materials. They must innovate not just around products, but also with their business models, to create a lean, efficient and cost-effective ecosystem that runs from the supply chain through to customers, from whom they receive real-time data and insights on product usage. Through these actions, manufacturers can translate insights from data into profitable business models for today’s data economy. This is a major paradigm shift. In the past, products were sold as capital equipment churning huge revenues. In the data economy, the aim for manufacturers is to build a revenue stream by selling more services.
To match the rapid pace of change in their customers’ preferences, manufacturers also have to be ready to run their business models like a social network—distributed yet connected, real-time and with a non-linear propagation. They also have technological and operational capabilities to support these ongoing changes, in products, data management, and services.
Still, many consumer and B2B companies have yet to begin making their products smart and connected. Only about a quarter (26%) of the 800 large companies we surveyed around the globe in 2015 said they had made a smart, connected product. What’s more, they estimate they devoted less than a third of their Internet of Things budgets to smart product monitoring.
But companies will very soon pay a competitive price for sitting on the sidelines in the smart, connected product space. The cost of IoT sensors is rapidly declining, from $1.30 in 2004 to a predicted $0.38 in 2020.7 Bandwidth, processing, and storage costs have also declined several tenfolds over the last decade. The analytics systems required to make sense of the data produced by smart, connected devices are also becoming more advanced.
As these trends continue, sensor technology will become ubiquitous. Gartner forecasts that 8.4 billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2017, reaching 20.4 billion by 2020.8 The Boston Consulting Group predicts that companies will spend $267 billion on IoT technologies, products and services in 2020.9
Nearly every manufacturer today should be exploring making their products smart and connected—not simply because the cost of doing so is dropping dramatically, but because there are increasingly clear benefits to doing so.
And the stakes for failing to ask the question could mean the difference between future success and failure.
Seven Business Benefits of Smart, Connected Products
When a product—whether a $35,000 automobile or a $150 electric toothbrush—is ‘smart’, it has sensors, processors, and software embedded in them that can track key aspects of their performance—fuel performance or toothbrushing execution. And when that product is ‘connected’, it can wirelessly transmit the data it collected.
When companies are able to continuously analyze the data streaming from these products, it opens up a world of potential business value and competitive advantage. It creates the unprecedented ability to monitor products at the most important stage of their lifecycle—when they are in the customer’s hands. That provides an unambiguous, new source of business intelligence in a wide variety of areas—from product performance to customer experience. Smart, connected capabilities are already enabling manufacturers of both high- and low-end products to reimagine not just their products, but also their business models.
When companies are able to continuously analyze the data streaming from these products, it opens up a world of potential business value and competitive advantage.
While the business value of a smart, connected product will vary by industry, market factors, and customer needs, we have identified 7 benefits that await businesses, which embrace them.
Faster, more effective product updates and development.
Because manufacturers can continuously monitor products in use, they can update their products, patch problems, and rethink functionality—all of which improves customer satisfaction. The intelligence from smart, connected products can also inform future product features and new product development. We are all familiar with automatic app updates on our phones, giving us access to new features or fixing problems over the air. Smart, connected products can update themselves in the same way. Diebold, for example, can update and add new features to its smart, connected ATMs remotely via software.0 Fitbit has been able to increase its new product development thanks to the information it has on how customers use the fitness band—and those new offerings can come in the form of either hardware or software options.11
Cheaper, more efficient maintenance and repair.
Because smart, connected products can be monitored in the field, that data can be used to significantly streamline the process of maintenance and repair. Rolls Royce tracks the health of thousands of aircraft engines operating worldwide using onboard sensors and live satellite feeds. Its Engine Health Management system can predict when something might go wrong to address it proactively or transmit data on an engine problem so airlines can have their service technicians ready with the right part to make repairs when it lands, resulting in less downtime.12
New, better business models.
Many industrial manufacturers are remaking themselves as service providers by creating new business lines based on the analysis of smart product data. GE Digital, for example, launched its Brilliant Manufacturing software and service using real-time visibility into smart, connected machines to help customers maintain equipment based on operating conditions (rather than a breakdown), thus driving greater efficiency.13 In fact, some companies may see a benefit in shifting their business models from selling goods to renting products and offering services. Michelin, for example, has gone to market with a smart, connected tire that is a product-service hybrid. Fleet customers sign up for their customized tire lease programs and pay by the mile for their usage while Michelin oversees any maintenance or repair.14
The data that manufacturers gather from their smart, connected products may also have value to other companies or organizations that would pay for it. For example, analysis of P&G’s Oral-B Genius data could be sold to retailers or dentists who could use that intelligence to better run their own businesses. Or, consider the opportunity that an automaker has to send useful information to motorists through an in-car infotainment system—such as the location of a parking lot or a nearby event. The automaker becomes a medium through which other businesses communicate to prospective customers.
Improved product usage.
A smart, connected product can provide intelligence and guidance to customers to help them make better use of it or engage more deeply with the brand. Progressive Insurance, which has a usage-based auto insurance product built upon in-car telematics sensors and monitoring, is one example. It launched a mobile app for customers that, at the end of each trip, gives drivers personalized information, including a one- to five-star rating, a data summary, a map of their drive, and tailored driving tips, to help them improve their score.15
Better product recall processes.
Poorly handled product defects and hazards can be enormously expensive to brands, not only in direct costs but reputational damage, as evidenced by incidents such as Takata’s giant and expanding airbag recall which drove it to bankruptcy16 and Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recall, which cost the company $5.3 billion.17 With sensing, connectivity, and the ability to detect a customer’s product problems, manufacturers can uncover dangerous defects more quickly and provide fixes more effectively. When the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that a Tesla Motors’ charger plug had been discovered to cause fires, Tesla owners didn’t have to do anything; the company provided an ‘over the air’ software update to fix it.18
Reduced environmental impact.
Manufacturers of smart, connected products can retain more control over what happens to a product not only during the lifecycle of its first purchase, but how it might be reused or recycled to reduce its negative environmental impact. Companies that can track individual products can better ensure its parts are recycled correctly or even reused in entirely new ways rather than being dumped in landfills.
Some visionary manufacturers are adopting a product-as-a-service approach that ensures that this is the case. For instance, if a telecom company provides handsets or smartphones as a part of its service contracts, it may collect, refurbish, and reuse them in areas where there is an economic need to provide less expensive options. With a lifetime of performance data, manufacturers can also offer reconditioned products with warranties similar to new options.
More intelligent, adaptive supply chains.
Industrial equipment manufacturers can deploy ‘digital twins’: 3-D virtual-reality replicas of their physical products to help them model manufacturing flows and figure out how to eliminate bottlenecks or adapt to changes. As data streams in, the digital stand-in shows how the product reacts to various conditions. It then demonstrates how it can be used to “provide new insights into how products can be better designed, manufactured, operated, and serviced,” according to Porter and Heppelmann.19
Ultimately, manufacturers can embrace not just connected, but cognitive supply chains to enable automated just-in-time or just-in-sequence manufacturing.
How to Evaluate Your Smart, Connected Opportunity
It’s becoming clear that for most manufacturers it should no longer be a question of ‘if’ they make their products smart and connected, but ‘when’. Those that wait too long to adapt to this new reality will get left behind.
Still, manufacturers must be prudent in their approach in this arena. Efforts to develop smart, connected products for the sake of doing so without a clear understanding of transformation requirements and business value are bound to fail. While the barrier to entry in the smart, connected product world is low—and getting lower by the day—companies must be thoughtful about what they will do with the data these intelligent products will collect. Figure 1 gives some examples of issues to consider.

Figure 1: Smart Products: Factors to Consider
Product and service differentiation.
Companies should begin evaluating their opportunities for connected products by figuring out whether this approach would create any significant differentiation in the product category. Will it make their product more attractive to purchase? Could it inform better product development later on? Boeing’s 787, which has now been in service for six years, generates more data every day than the rest of the company’s fleet does in their lifetimes. That has helped the aircraft manufacturer not only improve the performance of the Boeing 787 to the benefit of its customers; it has also informed the development of the company’s latest model, the Boeing 737 Max.20
Quantifying customer value.
Manufacturers should also think about what kind of value—and how much—making a product smart and connected would generate for customers. The interaction customers have with a product can help determine the right approach. High-involvement products, such as vehicles or smartphones, typically have many features and thus customers can benefit greatly from the guidance provided by a smart, connected version. Low-involvement products, like computer printers or coffee machines, tend to have much less functionality but may still benefit from sensors and connectivity that relieve customers of burdens like reordering supplies or maintenance.
Existing product usage patterns.
Companies should also think about how companies use a product before developing a smart, connected plan for it. High-utility products, like a fitness tracker, will provide many more data points, than a smart toothbrush. Thus the data may have more or wider value in the broader business ecosystem.
Your data management capabilities.
Finally, manufacturers must ensure that they are prepared to manage the explosion of digital data that smart, connected products will produce. They will need to set up the appropriate cloud infrastructure to manage these huge and growing volumes of product data. They will also have to invest in product-specific analytic capabilities and processes to generate insight based on the data. And they will need to rethink their processes to integrate that insight and act on it.
Next Steps
In the digital era, where customer experience is the competitive differentiator and creating sustainable competitive advantage is a top priority, making products smart and connected will make sense for most manufacturers. An intelligent approach for manufacturers that want to pursue this opportunity calls for them to:

Invest in building their network of IoT partners and collaborators

Map out their place in a smart, connected product services-based economy

Forecast the business models that smart, connected products may lead them to pursue

Adapt low-cost sensors that may be used in their product categories

Determine whether to build an IoT platform or buy the platform as a service

Develop a robust security strategy for connected products data

Involve legal and compliance professionals in developing the infrastructure that will support smart, connected products.


Smart, connected products are here. Firms that get a head start can strengthen their market position. They can also demonstrate to customers that they are pursuing new ways to deliver increased value. Manufacturers that find innovative ways to turn products into successful services will win.

40,"Organizations have long performed what-if simulations and scenario planning to test strategies and tactics, try out product concepts and service approaches, and assess the potential impact of new business models. In fact, consumers and companies today are the beneficiaries of computer simulations of complex conditions ranging from weather forecasts to the performance of aircrafts that are still on the drawing boards.
Until recently, such computer simulations were largely the realm of major government entities or large companies with access to the multimillion-dollar high-performance computing systems required to run them. Now, the emergence of cloud computing opens up a world of possibilities for companies that have long wanted to experiment with simulations but lacked the resources to do so. In short, cloud computing makes simulation opportunities abundant and economical. Just as important, the digital data that’s necessary to perform these simulations is plentiful and increasing exponentially.
The same cloud computing infrastructure that gave us cheaper email systems or subscription-based salesforce automation software is now making sophisticated software tools—many of them open sourced, some available for a credit card fee—available to a vastly wider audience. These tools, such as those that manage data exchanges among different systems, make it possible to perform the calculations required for simulations. Other tools manage the security of corporate data for simulations. And because a company can share data and computing power with partners via the cloud, such platforms enable a host of new applications.
More companies are facing a pressing need for business data visibility across the entire supply and distribution chain to make informed planning and production decisions. An automaker, for example, may decide it needs to go beyond its tier one suppliers to second- or third-tier firms to gain more control over supply timelines, and prevent unexpected downtimes for assembly lines. This calls for a connected ecosystem of IT and processes that spans several independent companies’ disparate computing environments, enabling the automaker to mine the data, and simulate possibilities. Now with cloud platforms, connecting a complete chain of systems becomes easier to simulate. This scenario also opens possibilities for the automaker to monetize data assets—like data on equipment performance, transportation lead times, and consumer product buying patterns—by exposing such insights to ecosystem partners.
Further, by conducting simulations in a cloud vendor’s data center, a company can reduce the cost and risk of conducting these experiments. For example, a bank or a retailer planning a digital transformation can run a simulation to model the impact on the sales and profitability of integrating multiple consumer channels.
With significant computing power now available on demand, companies have the potential to run simulations on just about anything for which they have ample, quality data. They make it possible to pose questions they have not been able to ask before and test more ideas.
But just because companies can run computer simulation models on virtually every aspect of their business, does not mean they should. Making the best use of the requisite infrastructure, analytics talent, data management, and IT skills, requires a strategy for simulations. Companies should determine what business questions simulations are best able to answer: whether it is optimizing the supply chain, pursuing an omnichannel marketing strategy, or scheduling asset maintenance. The approaches will vary depending on a company’s industry, strategy, and tactics.
Simulation Sweet Spots
Companies in a spectrum of industries have been doing cloud-based simulations for a variety of uses. For example, since the beginning of the decade, Varian Medical Systems, a $3 billion scientific-instruments company, has been running intensive ‘Monte Carlo’ computer simulations of design prototypes. That has accelerated product development.
A design for a mass spectrometer that would have taken six weeks to develop using internal computing resources, takes just a day in the cloud at a fraction of the cost.1
University of Arizona researchers looking to develop new drugs to fight ALS are using high-performance computing resources in the public cloud to run molecular modeling simulations in just a few hours that would otherwise take months.2 Using a public cloud, Major League Baseball built a tracking system that ingests videotaped player performance data from ballparks across North America. The goal: to simulate how athletes could have made better running, fielding, and other plays.3 Milliman, a global provider of actuarial products and services for the life insurance industry, has lessened the cost and complexity of its compute-intensive financial modeling, which evaluates thousands of economic scenarios, by conducting it in the public cloud.4
These early adopters have a number of characteristics in common.
They have ready access to huge amounts of data. For example, a major airline simulates the impact of flight delays on the crew management and flight scheduling. It can also examine how delays affect customer loyalty, revenue, and crew costs by using data from multiple sources. These simulation programs built using cloud-based technologies increased the airline’s ability to reschedule crews based on predicted delays, and reduced costs on hotels and transportation for crews, among other benefits.
They identify situations where cloud-based simulations can make a big business impact. Companies using the cloud for simulations create use cases where the ability to predict the performance of a product, service, or process can significantly improve revenues or outcomes, or substantially reduce costs and risks. Financial services firm Aon Benfield, for example, uses a high-performance public cloud-computing platform to simulate the performance of its five million insurance retirement products, and better determine its exposure to market risks.5
They do simulations to react far faster and better to daily business conditions. Cloud-based modeling is an ideal approach for situations in which it’s critical to act rapidly or in real-time. Global food company Kellogg uses public cloud infrastructure to test the impact of potential marketing programs. Every day, it runs dozens of complex data simulations on TV ad spending, digital marketing, coupon campaigns, and other promotions, sales commissions, and display and shelving costs.6 These simulations reduce waste in making these decisions, reduce time to market, and boost revenue.
They do simulations to reveal new business models. The ability to conduct multiple experiments through simulations—to explore how to make a business operation more efficient or more profitable—can help executives identify new ways of generating revenue. Simulations help answer if such ideas are feasible. For example, a consortium of banks can experiment with selling services to other financial institutions to help the banks comply with a new regulation.
Seven Prime Use Cases for Cloud Simulations
There is a wide range of potential applications for cloud-powered simulations. We have found seven areas where many organizations are generating the greatest benefit:
1. Asset management and optimization.
Companies are using simulation modeling to predict when their assets are about to fail and may need to be repaired or replaced. General Electric’s Power & Water division has developed virtual plants, using real-time simulation in the cloud. Using so-called ‘digital twins’ of critical pieces of equipment, the company can model the state of every asset in its gas power plants and wind farms.7
2. Research and development.
High-performance cloud infrastructure can be valuable for product development—enabling organizations to evaluate designs, test performance, and prevent quality issues quickly and cost effectively. Consumer products giant Unilever, for example, is combining data generated in its labs with publicly available microbial genetic data to develop new deodorants and other products.8
The cloud can enable similar simulation capabilities in medical research and development. Harvard Medical School’s Laboratory for Personalized Medicine is using a cloud-computing platform to develop genome analysis testing models, speeding up research on the clinical value of new genetic tests.9 Pharmaceutical company Novartis likewise accelerates it pre-clinical R&D efforts for drug development in the public cloud.10
3. Human capital management.
Several companies are using cloud-based simulations to recruit employees better and assign them to the right roles. A company may discover that an MBA graduate does not necessarily correlate with longevity with the company; however, it may dig deeper to discover that MBAs in smaller markets are less likely to leave while those in metropolitan areas are more likely to switch jobs.11
4. Customer experience.
Companies are using computer-modeling techniques to predict customer receptiveness to new products, services, offers or product functionality, from a new app to a new banking product. For example, one fashion retailer uses data from multiple channels—sales transactions, customer website visits, online and mobile behavior—to simulate the impact of discount offers on products at particular times (such as a holiday festival) to determine which will be most profitable. The simulations were successful in improving repeat sales and enhanced revenues on specific product lines.
5. Fraud detection.
Many firms are using cloud resources to help identify, respond to, and potentially prevent fraud. Banking giant HSBC, for example, uses the public cloud in its anti-money laundering efforts. The bank runs analytics and machine learning on enormous data sets to identify patterns that indicate nefarious activity, which it can then escalate to the appropriate government agencies.12
6. Customer service and field service.
In the same way that airlines and utilities use modeling for the predictive maintenance of their own assets, cloud-based simulations can help companies troubleshoot service and performance issues for customers. As companies accumulate more data from internet of things connected products and field service calls, they can model scenarios to create a more flexible, on-demand field service function.
7. Inventory management.
Using the same principle as field service simulations, organizations with very remote divisions or service areas (such as remote health centers) can use cloud-based computer models to determine how best to serve and operate their far-flung units.
Where to Begin
Companies that want to pursue promising simulation opportunities need to address a number of business and technical issues before proceeding.
Tie simulations to critical business issues. First and foremost, organizations need to clearly define the problem they’re trying to solve—or the questions they’re attempting to answer—with computer simulation. Simulations are, by definition, experiments. But that does not mean they should be undisciplined. Rather, companies must ensure the simulations that they try have a business benefit attached.
Practice strong data management to ensure quality simulations. Companies must have the right infrastructure, tools, and processes in place to manage the volume of data required for computer simulations and validate data quality. Companies must ensure that data from disparate sources are put into formats that can be combined for purposes of simulation; otherwise they can create conflicts during the modeling process. Simulations are only as good as the data fed into them. And don’t forget about the team doing this work. The investment of time, money, and talent required to prepare the data for these efforts is often underestimated and should be budgeted for from day one.
Use simulations to ‘fail fast’ and improve the next time. A computer simulation is always a work in progress. It must be refined over time with frequent changes to improve the model. That requires a much less rigid mindset and approach than a standard software project with strict governance and delivery date. Computer modeling benefits from a more agile approach. Organizations that pursue must invest in the increased time and overhead required to supervise the process and refine results.
While not every business problem is right for simulation, there are undoubtedly simulation opportunities for all businesses across industries. And now is the time to determine where the greatest opportunities are. The computing power is accessible. The data is available in greater quantities and varieties than ever before. If you don’t take advantage of the opportunities to perform complex simulations using high performance cloud assets, chances are a competitor or an upstart will.

41,"A growing number of manufacturers are digitally connecting to their products after they leave the shop floor. These companies are monitoring the experience their customers are having with those products throughout the customer lifecycle. By doing so, manufacturers can continue adding value to customers after the sale, and even develop new revenue streams.
This phenomenon is especially visible in industrial manufacturing. For example, one turbine manufacturer is offering remote diagnostics-as-a-service, resolving 85% of alerts remotely. That reduces turbine downtime (saving the customer money) and the frequency of field service visits (lowering its costs and customers’ service costs).
Such digital connectivity allows aircraft engine makers like General Electric and Pratt & Whitney to monitor engine performance even during flights. By doing so, these manufacturers have evolved a new business model of ‘servitization’—charging customers ‘power by the hour,’ rather than selling or leasing their engines outright. That generates a recurring revenue stream, while eliminating a significant capital expense and maintenance costs for customers.
A 2015 TCS Global Trends Study found the industrial manufacturing sector was second out of 13 global industries surveyed in what the average company spent on IoT as a percentage of revenue.1
All this is made possible by the Internet of Things (IoT), which is increasingly penetrating all areas of manufacturing. A more recent study by IDC found the industrial manufacturing sector is now number one in IoT spending.2
The Competitive Advantage of a Deeper Customer Understanding
A company’s ability to deeply understand how customers are using its products is transformational. GE CEO, Jeff Immelt, said the new businesses his company is creating by digitally connecting its industrial products to customers’ operations is “the most important thing [CEOs are] going to work on, at least in this era.”3 He warned CEOs who fail to invest in this area do so at their own peril.
By intimately understanding how customers use their products, manufacturers are now able to make big improvements in the customer experience. In particular, they can shift from reactive, break-fix services, to predictive services that help prevent their products from breaking in the first place. For example, electric car maker Tesla received a recall notice in 2014 from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Tesla was able to fix over 22,000 cars without assuming the expense of a multimillion-dollar recall—and without inconveniencing its customers by forcing them to drive to dealers to drop off their cars.
How did Tesla do it? Simply by wirelessly releasing a software patch to the cars.4 As Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman says, “Our business model runs on uptime for customers. If we run at a lower cost than our competition, we win.”5 In this instance, Tesla won.
The manufacturer-customer connection, enabled by digitalization, is especially critical to manufacturers beset by commoditization. By adding digital services to products, they can create new revenue streams and differentiate themselves and their products. For many manufacturers, this digitalization lets them shift from being just a maker and distributer, to also providing service to customers, whether they are other businesses or consumers. Some manufacturers hope to move from a 90-10 product-service ratio to 50-50, to increase margins and develop recurring revenue streams.6
To make this transformation, a manufacturer must gain a 360-degree view of its customers throughout the lifecycle in which they use its products. This is far different from a transactional snapshot retrieved when the product is sold, serviced, and returned. It requires shifting the focus from upfront product sales revenue to lifetime revenue from customers.
By having a continuous data stream flowing into its systems, a manufacturer can tailor its products to how customers use them. It can also allow customers to customize the product and how they use it. For example, when GE monitored how its engines on Alitalia planes were consuming fuel, the Italian airline changed the wing flap positions in landings. This reduced fuel use and, of course, Alitalia’s costs. It was mutually beneficial for both companies, and was made possible by the continuous digital monitoring that creates a more-than-transactional relationship.7
Such customer product usage data will ultimately give the manufacturers that possess it something their competitors do not have: insight into what other products and services the customer will need. And that will produce more than new product and revenue opportunities. It will allow manufacturers to charge a premium (even for commoditized goods) and, more importantly, provide an enduring competitive advantage.
How Manufacturers Can Get from Here (Today) to There (Tomorrow)
To gain this competitive advantage through digitalization, manufacturers must begin by developing an overarching business strategy because they must change their business model. They have to think hard about how to create and maintain that competitive advantage over time.
Many services a company rolls out can—and will—be quickly copied by competitors. Consequently, executives must think about developing products to which they can add features continuously. At the same time, they must simplify and lower the cost of the business processes that provide the services attached to those products. Digitalization has a great potential to reduce cost of operations and build trust with customers through transparent and real-time visibility in sales and service.
Manufacturers have key choices to make here. One is whether to sell a product or maintain ownership and sell the product as a service (i.e., servitization), charging only for the use of the asset. This is becoming the case not only with end products but also components of a product or system—for example, airplane engines (as power by the hour) and truck tires (as Michelin now does, charging fleet owners a per-kilometer rate).8 Indeed, some manufacturers believe after-sale transactions may be more profitable than the sale of the product itself. They’re launching services for repair and troubleshooting their products, and selling follow-on products and services (such as updated GPS mapping systems for automobiles).
Another choice that manufacturers have here is about the channels for connecting with customers. Traditionally, many manufacturers sold and serviced their products through distributors and dealers. But today’s digital portals let manufacturers connect directly to end customers.
If its strategy is one of servitization, then a manufacturer must keep a rich digital connection to the products that are in customers’ hands. If it can continually monitor the condition of its products, a manufacturer can develop a more detailed and accurate picture of how to price its support services and warranties.
Several car insurance companies are tracking their customers’ driving behaviors to more precisely price the policies they offer and sell additional features. Indeed, the number of drivers now enrolled in pay-how-you drive programs has doubled since 2013. Progressive, one of America’s largest car insurers, has 4 million usage-based customers. Its policies are based on telematic technologies that use machine learning algorithms. Such insurers can adjust premiums on an almost real-time basis, which benefits them (by reducing their risks) and their better-driving customers (who pay less).9
Your business strategy must also determine how much income your company can retrieve—not on a quarterly basis, but over an extended period. Generally, the higher the value of the product (such as aircraft engines and luxury cars), the greater the opportunity for after-sale profits derived from digital connectivity. Lower-value products—think coffee makers, toasters, and barbecue grills—have shorter product lifecycles. They are more likely to be replaced than repaired. They, therefore, will have a lower return on digital investment.
That said, IoT enables manufacturers of all products to make money on them after the sale. The question is not if, but where they can make money.
Importantly, manufacturers must develop infrastructure and partner ecosystems capable of collecting and analyzing the volumes of digital data coming from the field. Most manufacturers are still aggregating data above the local field level. However, few companies outside the energy industry collect information on a customer-by-customer basis. That data is still owned primarily by retailers and channel partners (if they have robust CRM systems).
That’s why it’s so important for manufacturers to be transparent with their channel and distribution partners. To get their data, you must share your own. That may mean sharing leads with distributors and/or developing robust communication pathways to exchange product maintenance information.
Finally, manufacturers need to change their corporate mindsets from product purveyors to service providers. This means focusing investments on marketing, sales, and, above all, customer relations. From a financial perspective, shifting revenue from immediate sales to service and product usage over time must be modeled carefully. Key performance metrics need to be customer-focused (e.g., customer satisfaction measures and customer lifetime value) rather than sales volume and one-time sales revenue.
Your core service mindset must be about helping the customer use and get value from your products. The R&D function must also become customer-centric. It must examine product features through the customer’s lens, looking at enhancements that will improve the customer experience rather than adding the next new cool feature that customers may neither value nor be willing to pay for.
A New Business Era
One doesn’t need a crystal ball to see that the future of manufacturing lies in developing digitally connected products that continually report back to the companies that made them (or to the retailer that sold them).
That’s why using IoT technologies to improve the customer experience after the customer takes possession of a product is now so critical to the future of many manufacturers.

42,"Manufacturers everywhere are using sensors, software, and wireless connectivity to add features to their products and differentiate them in the marketplace. In this way, digitization and the Internet of Things (IoT) are revolutionizing the sector across categories and geographies.
To be sure, the idea of connected products isn’t news to manufacturers. In 1996, General Motors (GM) began offering its on-board OnStar1 concierge service in Cadillacs. What GM did then has become ubiquitous. General Electric (GE) estimates that investments in industrial IoT alone would surpass $60 trillion in the next 15 years. Meanwhile, leading B2B and consumer companies are rushing to connect everything they make from jet engines to tractors to refrigerators to electric toothbrushes.

Figure 1: Illustration of a Closed-Loop System for a typical utilities company that includes the ability to gain performance insights from customers’ experience using energy systems.
It’s a trend that extends beyond major firms. A myriad of startups are seeking investors for all manners of newly imagined, IoT-enabled products. At the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, a startup called ShadeCraft unfurled a smart patio umbrella.2
But that isn’t all manufacturers are doing with connected, smart products. In the process of connecting their products, manufacturers are unlocking a new business model. This model harbors a wealth of opportunities for manufacturers to better serve their existing customers, expand their markets, and drive profitable revenue growth.
Closing the Value-Generation Loop
The powerful new business model in manufacturing is enabled by a mashup of digitization and servitization—that is, the process of adding services to products. When manufacturers add service components to a connected product, they open up new ways to generate value to customers and to themselves. As we describe it, they gain the ability to shift from an open-loop system to a closed-loop system of value generation. Figure 5 describes the aspects of that shift.
Lost Opportunities in Open-Loop Systems
 
Most manufacturers operate in an open-loop system. They sell their products to OEMs or through indirect distribution channels composed of wholesalers, dealers, and/or retailers. As a result, manufacturers don’t have direct, real-time sources of data that can tell them how end customers are using (or misusing) their products and how their products are performing (or not performing). They have limited insight into what benefits or problems their customers experience. Their data on customer usage is ‘open,’ meaning it escapes their reach.
Most manufacturers are beginning to realize that this open-loop system is a missed opportunity, and that limited contact with end customers is a major obstacle to growth.
Overcoming this obstacle is difficult and expensive. More often than not, manufacturers lose crucial data. Savvy manufacturers try to work with their channel partners, but feedback loops break down and, in many instances, their channel partners simply do not or cannot gather the data. In any case, warranty claims arrive long after customers have been disappointed and the opportunity for a proactive response is gone.
Even more valuable opportunities are lost in an open-loop system. When manufacturers don’t have a direct link to their end customers, they don’t know and can’t respond to how customers use their products (or hack their products to make them do things manufacturers never imagined). These are lost opportunities to build new revenue streams and enhance customer loyalty.
How Smart, Connected Products Close the Loop

In a closed-loop system, a manufacturer has a direct and ongoing digital link to end customers: access to information about the product, how the customer is using it, and any problems the customer may be having with it.
IoT technologies enable manufacturers to create a closed loop system. When they make their products smart and connected, manufacturers that sell to OEMs and through indirect distribution channels can maintain a direct link to end customers.
Moreover, emerging technologies are making closed loop systems easier and more economical than ever before. In communications, the new 5G network standard promises much faster transmission of digital data. In computing, public clouds and ever more powerful processing promise to reduce costs associated with storing, analyzing, and gaining insights from customer product usage data.
Closed-loop systems represent a paradigm shift for most manufacturers. Product makers can now know the ultimate truth about their products: how they are performing (or not performing) for customers. They can receive continuous, real-time information about their products while those products are in the end customers’ hands. They can understand how efficiently customers are using their products, when the product is nearing a breakdown, and a host of vital information.
Closed-loop systems open up a vast frontier of opportunity for manufacturers that are encompassed in the term servitization.
The Bountiful Promise of Servitization
Servitization is a fundamental rejiggering of the traditional manufacturing model. It harks back to something Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt wrote 40 years ago: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole.”3
A manufacturer that pursues servitization as strategy taps into Levitt’s timeless truth. It shifts its primary focus from creating value by making and selling a product to creating value by delivering a service through a product. The manufacturer may or may not make money selling the product itself, but it does make money by providing the service embedded in the product.
We find that servitization opportunities come in four flavors:
1. Enhancing reliability and uptime.
Whether it’s a truck, boiler, air compressor or any other machine, manufacturers can embed monitoring services in their products. Then, they can act (or alert their customers to act) before product failures occur. This creates customer value by raising product reliability, maximizing uptime, and reducing overall maintenance costs. All this builds value in the brand.
Maersk Drilling’s partnership with GE is an example of this at work. After a successful pilot project, Maersk is deploying a GE system to analyze the performance of 110 key pieces of equipment at nine additional offshore drilling rigs. The sensors on equipment enable GE to tell Maersk when it’s time to perform maintenance, before the equipment breaks down. That saves Maersk time and money.4
2. Customer operational improvement.
Manufacturers can embed services that optimize the value customers get from using a product. For instance, Rolls Royce’s jet engines include smart technologies and connectivity that enable them to advise airlines on optimal flight speeds and other operating metrics that produce the lowest fuel costs.5
Automakers could provide similar services to consumers, for instance, advising them how to accelerate and brake in ways that maximize fuel economy. So could energy utilities—by tracking in real-time precisely how much energy its customers are using and advising them how to reduce their costs.
3. Selling new product capabilities.
By embedding service delivery capabilities such as software downloads in their products, manufacturers can tap into new product, subscription, and streaming revenues. Toyota is offering its car owners new mapping systems and other apps that can be downloaded as software.6 Tesla has offered to sell the owners of its electric vehicles a software download that adjusts the car’s suspension settings to provide them with more road clearance at high speeds.7
4. New revenue-generating businesses.
Perhaps the most valuable potential of servitization is when it enables manufacturers to develop entirely new businesses. They can uncover the insights that lead to such businesses by using smart, connected products to gain a deeper understanding of customer experience. Kaeser Kompressoren did this: It no longer sells air compressors; it sells air compression as a service as it monitors the usage of its machines.8 One reason connected cars have spawned a competitive race in the auto industry is the many revenue-generating businesses they make possible including mobile advertising. Imagine driving your car and getting personalized, location-based offers in your dashboard infotainment system: a hotel just 5 miles ahead offering a 50% discount, or a steak restaurant with tables available on a busy Friday night. That world will soon arrive.
The experience of Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, the maker of thermal power generation systems, shows the potential of the servitization approach. Working with TCS, the global firm is developing an artificial intelligence-based system to adjust the combustion process of coal-fired power plants to reduce costs and carbon-dioxide emissions.9 The system, which it plans to sell to other plant operators, collects nearly 250 data inputs about the performance of a power boiler. It is designed to determine how best to tune the boiler for maximum efficiency by testing more than 10,000 combinations. The case demonstrates the value of a closed-loop system in which Mitsubishi is combining its expertise in power plants with AI capabilities to sell its engineering and product knowledge as a service.
Overcoming the Resistance to Servitization
The promise of servitization is tantalizing. That’s why 48% of UK manufacturers are planning to increase their investments in servitization in 2018.10 Yet 44% admitted they are servitization beginners. They, and indeed, all leaders of manufacturing companies that are seeking to capture the opportunities of servitization, will need to be prepared to encounter internal and external resistance that appears whenever business model change is undertaken. Among the challenges:
Core business dominance: Every well-established company has a dominant core business model. The managers responsible for operating this model often find it difficult to reimagine it. Change can be especially challenging when it involves new and unfamiliar technologies. (Recall that Kodak executives were aware that digital photography threatened the company’s survival but failed to act.) Resistance stemming from the dominant business can remain strong even after pilots are run and proof of concept is delivered. Often, manufacturing executives continue to project their own resistance to change on their customers—either claiming customers will not pay for the service or doing little to help sell the service to customers, or both.
Approach to take: Conduct design thinking workshops, which employ both an understanding of IT systems and creative problem-solving exercises that look at issues like customer challenges from different viewpoints, to develop ideas for taking the business in new directions. Such exercises help companies to unearth new possibilities for creating value through new business ideas. The process can validate the best ideas while building support for them among different stakeholders.
Then evaluate options for a proof of concept project that will test the theory that the company’s offerings can include add-on services. Companies must assess their means to collect data on their products. They are likely to determine that they need to collect more.
The silo trap: Manufacturers, especially large established ones like many of the automakers, are organized into silos (design, engineering, production, marketing, etc.) that all too often operate independently. That can stymie servitization initiatives.
Approach to take: Engage executives across functions in a discussion of customer value. Assign a cross-functional team to assess existing information on the customer’s experience, including warranty claims and problem reports, and identify strengths, weaknesses and opportunities to expand the view. Then report on options to create a pilot test of a service offering.
Channel resistance: Manufacturers that launch servitization initiatives should also expect resistance from their sales, distribution, and service partners. Many dealers rely on a repairs and maintenance revenue that a new service model is expressly intended to reduce or eliminate. Further, servitization often carries with it the very real fear of disintermediation; you should expect dealers and other partners to protect their customer relationships.
Approach to take: To overcome channel resistance, manufacturers much reach out to their distribution partners and make accommodations. Proof of concept projects can help build evidence to show the value of new models to reluctant partners.
Customer inertia: With 20/20 hindsight, successful products and service bundles (such as Apple’s iPod) look like they were no-brainers from the start. But in reality, customers often do not recognize the value of service-embedded products, and don’t immediately flock to them. Companies must combat such customer reluctance with effective marketing that clearly states the value of the new offering.
Approach to take: Successful servitization requires a concerted effort at educating customers, especially consumers, on the value they would get and its price. Companies must overcome internal resistance and enlist employees in that effort. They should begin their servitization efforts with modest projects that do not require overly complex explanations. And they should be sure that customers understand both the rewards of the service model and the risks of improper use.
Servitization Is an Imperative
Leading manufacturers of all types are engaging in servitization. Sooner rather than later, those that fail to embed services in their products—and deliver the enhanced customer experiences that servitization promises—are going to be left behind.
This is especially true for any manufacturer that is in an open-loop system. Servitization offers an unprecedented opportunity to build tighter relationships with customers. They can use it to add intelligence to their products, collect valuable data on customer usage, inform design and performance improvements, and test those improvements before rolling them out at scale.
In short, servitization enables manufacturers to improve the reliability of their products, help their customers to obtain superior value, and develop new revenue generating businesses. The technologies needed to start embedding services in B2B and B2C products are available now. No manufacturer should be waiting to see what comes next.

43,"With digitally savvy disruptors seemingly making inroads in every sector, companies using so-called agile approaches to building new digital products and digital processes are becoming hard to beat. In just one example, the speed with which Amazon.com unveils new capabilities to its website—dozens of changes every day—has left many longstanding retailers in the dust or racing furiously to catch up. Even large financial services companies like ING of the Netherlands, have realized that they must organize and develop online systems in agile ways to keep pace with the explosion of online banking options.
However, in the last couple of years, companies that have mastered agile development have been leaping ahead in industries in which having excellent digital connections to customers is crucial to success. (Think financial services, high tech, retailing, and media.) It’s why 94% of companies are using agile approaches, according to a 2016 survey.1 The two biggest reasons they cited were to accelerate the delivery of software and to better manage changing priorities.
Companies that introduce new online processes or online products for customers are chasing competitors that can make changes to their online offerings weekly or even daily. If they used traditional approaches to building such systems, they would come to market way too late and (most likely) off target.
Yet not all agile projects are successful, and a key reason is how they are scoped and funded. Companies that scope and budget their agile development projects the same way they do their traditional systems projects are likely to come up far short in two ways:
1. They lock development teams into working on features of systems that may turn out to be not worth investing in (or, at least, spending as called for in the original plan) because customers don’t find them valuable. In this case, traditional budgeting doesn’t take advantage of the ability of agile teams to put products online and test them with customers early in the process. Getting early feedback from customers can save a company a lot of money. A firm can redirect funding away from less valuable to more valuable features.
2. They risk losing key members of their development teams, who are often assigned to other systems while the current projects are waiting for the next round of funding.
Research has found that nearly two-thirds of the features built into systems using traditional development methods are rarely or never used, and that the 20% that are used provide 80% of the value to customers.2
In this article, we discuss why scoping and budgeting of software projects delivered through agile development methods must be different than those used in traditional software development approaches. We explain why agile methods should initially provide a high-level, rather than a detailed, estimate of the time and the scope of effort required to deliver a system. Over time, as they build and test components with customers, the team will get a much more accurate and detailed estimate of time, scope, and budget. We also show why companies should fund agile programs not by their scope but rather by the value that their products bring to end customers or users (also known as “value streams”).
The Rise of Agile Techniques for a Digital Online World
Agile software development methods arrived at the turn of the 21st century, a time when companies had to build e-commerce, websites and other systems to compete for customers on the Internet. With the advent of the web in the mid-1990s, large companies had to develop systems that would be outward-facing—i.e., used by end customers outside their organizations—not just by their internal users. Suddenly, the traditional systems development process (often referred to as using the “waterfall” method to depict how the phases of requirements analysis, architecture, coding, testing and launch would follow one another across a calendar), which reliably produced internal systems, had become too slow, off-target and in other ways inadequate.3
A variety of agile methods arose: Scrum, Lean, Extreme Programming, Kanban, and others. They were different answers to the very same need—to produce software much faster, try it out on real customers far earlier (building systems for the web made that easy, since customers could use the system from their own computers and digital devices), and (based on that early customer feedback) allow developers to make quick adjustments to the system so it wasn’t obsolete the moment it went live a year or two later.
Agile methods differed dramatically from traditional development in at least five ways: scoping, schedule, cost estimates, deliverables and key success factors. To scope systems developed through traditional methods, teams are asked to make detailed estimates of project length and budget after doing extensive analysis of the system’s requirements. The more features and functions, and the more connections to other systems there are, the greater the system complexity and therefore, more people, time, and budget to do all the work.
In other words, for traditional systems development, the schedule depends on the scope of the effort estimated, and the cost is a function of that scope, and when the company needs the system to go live (i.e., the schedule). (Building a system faster requires assigning more team members, and thus increases the cost.) Yet developers know the least about the scope (and thus the time and cost) of a software project at the beginning. Their knowledge increases once they start delivering code, and it keeps improving the more they deliver.
The key to successful software projects based on waterfall methods is doing exceptional upfront requirements analysis so that the schedule and cost turn out to be fairly accurate.
Figure 1: Comparing Agile and Traditional Software Development
Agile development is built on this premise: If developers can release pieces of a system to users early in the development process, those developers will have a much better idea early in their process about the scope of the system. Those pieces are completed in short time frames—weeks, rather than months—in “plan > do > check > act” cycles.
In agile development, scoping, scheduling and cost estimation techniques are thus very different than they are in waterfall development. (See Figure 1)
The Problems of Software Budgeting in an Agile World
So here we are, 16 years after the Agile Manifesto emerged from the primordial software development soup. Yet most organizations (while embracing agile) are still scoping and budgeting them in the same way they structured and budgeted the big, monolithic systems projects of yesteryear. In other words, while agile development techniques are all the rage in the IT organization and the business functions they automate, the budget holder for technology in most companies (the finance organization) still doles out funding the old-fashioned way: by program, projects or stage gates (such as requirements, design, coding, testing, and so on). After requirements analysis is deemed complete, funds are released for the next phase (system architecture and development). Then once that’s done, funding needs to be approved for system testing, and so on.
For software development teams that build systems using agile methods, this has become a big problem for several reasons:

It locks teams into continuing to develop pieces of software that may not be useful to customers.

Teams get disbanded if project funding dries up. Valuable knowledge about the business processes of the product and technologies that enable those processes is lost.


The Answer: Scoping Smaller Releases and Funding Them Faster
So how should companies that need to develop systems through agile methods rethink their scoping and budgeting? We believe they should make three key changes: funding by “value stream” rather than by the entire program; launching low-cost, high-value products/features first and high-cost, low-value ones last; and continuously funding and giving the development team work that’s been prioritized thereby ensuring that the teams aren’t on hiatus.
Let’s look at each change.
Funding by value stream. The work of agile development teams should be funded with an economic view—i.e., how useful the product or feature is to customers or other end users. Let’s say a retailer’s top management gives its new e-commerce website a full year to bring it to market. Developed through traditional methods, none of the system would see the light of day (i.e., be online for customers to use) for that year. However, using agile methods, e-commerce and IT managers would prioritize the features of the system (i.e., price lookup, product descriptions, product reviews, one-click pricing, inventory checks in store locations, and so on) and begin putting them online far earlier—perhaps within weeks after they launched the project depending on the release cadence.
Funding this project the traditional way would have called for drawing on its total budget at each step of the development process: at the start, for requirements gathering and analysis; then (after requirements were inspected) before architecture and coding; then (after the architecture and coding were checked) before testing; and finally (if the testing went well) to put it into production. Or top management would allocate budget for the full scope of the project, tying up funds for a long duration regardless of whether the project meets its intended purpose or not when it is finally completed.
Launching high-value but high-cost value streams early. One of the biggest advantages that agile has over traditional systems building methods is the ability to break a big monolithic system into smaller pieces, and then go live with some of those pieces very early in the project, even in the first few months. The pieces you want to go live with first are those that everyone believes at the outset to be low-cost, yet high-return.
How budgeting of agile projects needs to change during the software development lifecycle

Figure 2: Adjusting the Budgets for Systems Built Through Agile Methods
The market feedback that the hypothetical retailer would get from introducing pieces of its new e-commerce website in weeks like those we’ve discussed would be highly valuable. It will reduce further funding of low-value but high-cost features. It will continue funding of high-value features. And it should increase funding for features proven to have high value but which don’t cost very much. (See Figure 2)
Delegating scoping and budgeting to the agile development teams. The whole reason to use agile development is to come to market far faster with a new online system, and get much earlier and frequent customer feedback on which features of the system to further develop or abandon. Hence the funding decision for agile development needs to be top down, as well as dynamic.
As such, we believe that making all this work well is best done when a company delegates the decisions on what pieces of the system to work on next to the product owners in the business (who best understand their product and its performance) and to the development teams (who best understand how long it would take to build it).
Of course, vesting that decision in the development team requires great trust by those who fund the system: the business unit, finance and IT heads. Your CFO must become comfortable with the notion that agile teams (which must include product managers/owner(s) from the business units and functions) will know best what system features are delivering value or not. It’s why the team, product owners, and managers must keep reviewing what’s being delivered and monitor its performance in the marketplace to utilize available funding most judiciously.
We don’t advise companies that are new to agile development to change the way they budget overnight. They need to first see the advantages of agile development and get accomplished at it. But those that are proficient with agile should consider giving their teams fixed budgets and then leave the scoping decisions to the team.
Ultimately, as leadership guru Stephen M.R. Covey once wrote about trust in business: whether the 
 agile teams gain and keep the trust of senior executives will depend on the results they generate and their integrity, intent, and capabilities.4
How This is Working at a Major Retailer
The retailer, whose name will go unmentioned, is competing against Amazon, as are numerous other retailers these days. But it realized in the last few years that how often it could update its e-commerce website, the systems in its stores, merchandising, buying, and other system were critical to competing effectively in a bricks-and-clicks world.
At this retailer, portfolio level budgeting is done top-down with joint decision by business and IT. Highest priority value streams5 get fixed funding for a fixed period without any elaborate bottom-up cost estimations based on detailed requirements upfront.
In fact, the company found that it had to change the organization structure of the IT department to make agile methods work well. So rather than being organized around IT domains such as business analysis, coding, systems analyst, testing, and so on, the new organization is structured by online “product” area: point of sales applications, HR applications, vendor negotiation applications, and so forth. Agile teams in each product area have the requisite business analysis, systems analysis, UI designers, developers, testers, and other skills necessary to build, test, and go live with an online product in their area.
The result of embracing agile, and new ways to scope and budget for agile-developed systems, has been sizable: faster system rollouts, fewer technology incidents, and a workplace that lures new systems engineering talent to the company.
The New World of Systems Scoping and Budgeting
Companies like the retailer mentioned above, ING, Netflix, Spotify, and Google are leading the way on how systems scoping and budgeting must change in a world of digital systems built through agile methods. Those companies that embrace and master agile methods, and then scope and budget for them in ways that provide highly valuable early feedback, are getting a big leg up in the race to be digital.

44,"The Internet of Things (IoT) opens up opportunities for companies to improve visibility of their operations and the products they make by collecting data from sensors attached to a range of machines, from controllers at factories to aircraft engines. But while many companies are embedding sensors and wireless communications devices into their industrial control systems and products, each implementation has the potential to open up their systems to hackers who can steal data or disrupt operations.
In the U.S., IoT incidents logged by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security rose more than seven-fold between 2010 (39 incidents) and 2015 (295).1 Researchers project IoT will rise on the list of risks for chief information security officers (CISOs). Two-thirds of computer networks will see an IoT security breach by 2018, IDC researchers predict, adding that by 2020, 10% of all attacks will target IoT systems. Gartner analysts say they expect IoT security costs will rise to 20% of annual information security budgets by 2020, up from a rounding error (less than 1%) in 2015 budgets.
iiThe risks of a breach in corporate networks incorporating IoT capabilities are real. Examples abound:
A regional water company saw its web-based payment system and operational technology system hacked, an event that led to unauthorized manipulations of its programmable logic controllers.3
Researchers have identified security flaws in the communications protocols used in medical devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators that can be adjusted remotely without surgery.4
A demonstration by two hackers showed it was possible to gain control of a connected car with the knowledge of its IP address.5
The risks extend to consumer devices that interact with corporate networks. In 2016, malware called Mirai hijacked IoT devices such as closed-circuit video cameras and digital video recorders that used factory-default security settings. Those devices, in turn, attacked Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company that underpins top websites. The incident created problems for users at popular sites like Amazon, Twitter, Reddit, and Netflix.6
Such incidents demonstrate why companies must lock down their connected systems and networks, including the ones they use to design and manufacture their products and the connections they embed in their products.
The incidents show the vulnerability of interconnected systems that many parties have access to. And they point to the urgency that enterprise risk management leaders confront as they seek to maintain and improve existing defenses.
The Risks Embedded in IoT
The promise of IoT is that its technology can automate functions that are much more expensive to do manually. It’s impractical to employ large operations teams to monitor all plant equipment 24x7. It’s easy, and relatively cheap, to install sensors and connect them to a network that will alert managers to problems. It’s now feasible to equip advanced engines with devices that provide ongoing measures of their mechanical health.
But as IoT deployments have spread, risks have emerged. Manufacturers designed IoT devices with functionality in mind, not security. IoT devices are out in the field—attached to company products, in locations around the world—and are often not monitored centrally for attacks (unlike the corporate data center). As a result, practitioners see that attacks such as IoT botnets can spread quickly because many IoT devices are rarely patched or updated.7
In fact, the risks of IoT devices being hacked are far greater than they have been for any previous technology assets deployed by companies in at least three respects:

The large number of devices to monitor (millions, in the case of a large automaker instituting cloud-delivered infotainment systems or self-driving cars) makes the IoT a larger risk to manage than the thousands of laptops, desktops and mobile phones used by the employees of a major enterprise

The challenge is also more geographically dispersed due to IoT sensors embedded in products and machines installed or moving through corners of the world that are often far beyond where the company has offices and employees

The relatively new nature of the technology means there are heterogeneous platforms to manage. IoT devices are full of hardware and software from different vendors that make assessing vulnerabilities, patching software, and monitoring ongoing risks a multidimensional challenge


Know What You’re Dealing With
Addressing the IoT security challenge requires an understanding of your IoT landscape in detail. This includes analysis of what devices you have and at which point they may be vulnerable so that you can address critical security gaps. Companies must establish a group that will mitigate current problems and manage future risks. A comprehensive review requires eight steps:
        1.Appoint a centralized team accountable for IoT security.
A centralized team that includes the CISO must be accountable for securing the company’s IoT devices—and ensuring the firm’s ongoing compliance with risk management policies.
To establish this team, companies must evaluate the maturity (in terms of in-house skills and practices) of their IT organization and the operations technology (OT) organizations. In some companies, this exercise means confronting a cultural clash. While IT professionals typically have more experience managing information security based on experience and industry-established best practices, there nevertheless may exist a distrust between IT and OT based on each group’s unfamiliarity with the other.
A common organization that combines experts in control systems for operations facilities, such as integrated control systems, and IT security can bridge this gap. In addition, standards organizations for IT and OT can serve as a resource for the centralized team applying the same principles to OT devices, such as the ISO 27001 standard8 for information security management systems and the ISA/IEC-62443 standard to prevent cyber attacks on industrial operations.9
Once set up, the centralized team can:

Monitor control-systems compliance with corporate policies for managing IoT devices

Ensure that software patches are up to date for plant instrumentation, IoT devices, and infrastructure

Run regular audits for security practices

Conduct constant network monitoring


The team should also incorporate new best practices that emerge for IoT devices. For example, industrial service providers, including GE’s Achilles program, certify devices and the organizations that implement them for compliance to the IEC-62443 standard.10 Others provide IEC-62433 assessment services to organizations that deploy industrial systems. In addition, device manufacturers can provide maintenance and support remotely for their products. While a potential benefit to companies deploying IoT devices, such remote access must be controlled and secure.
         2. Locate your company’s critical IoT assets. 
The first priority is to identify all the connected devices and sensors your company uses, and then determine which ones represent a significant security risk. Companies often discover assets about which they were previously unaware. You must also distinguish between those assets that signify important risks and those that do not. Not every asset is critical. In some cases, the risk of a breach occurring through a particular device is less urgent than the resources required to address the remote chance of a problem.
With all that said, these assets are likely to be distributed across enterprise networks and geographical locations, and may be found in isolated networks within industrial plants. They will be present in both IT systems and OT systems, including:

End-point devices, such as PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile computers

Devices that move with transportation containers, trucks, and ships

Industrial control systems managed by supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, in factories and other facilities



Legacy infrastructure, such as the controllers that utilities use to manage flows of electricity, water and natural gas

         3. Identify the software vulnerabilities in your IoT assets.
Software vulnerabilities are the most significant risk facing IoT-connected devices. With an inventory of critical assets in hand, a company can assess which software governs the actions of each piece of hardware.
Different device manufacturers use their own conventions in software protocols, and each requires an assessment of its vulnerabilities. (For example, can a hacker exploit it remotely? How can such a weakness be fixed?) For some devices, changing the security settings in the product that was shipped can be enough to address a risk. For others, such as various generations of Windows devices, there may be known network vulnerabilities for which an immediate patch is available.
Failure to update software can leave systems susceptible to attacks, such as the one that occurred in May 2017 when a variant of the WannaCry ransomware program infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide.11 It is imperative to maintain updated software patches on critical assets.
         4. Discover devices that gain entry to your networks.
As companies assess their own devices and software, it is important to understand when new devices—whether they are company-owned or devices used by customers, business partners, or contractors—access corporate networks. Where possible, use technology that can automate the discovery of new devices.
However, you must manually detect isolated networks at industrial sites that support your IoT devices. Assess the vulnerability of these devices and execute patches on them. If they are owned by external parties, require the parties to do the same.
         5. Watch out for emerging threats.
Monitor all connected devices for evidence of new threats such as distributed denial of service attacks. Such attacks often arise from either a software developer error or the open source software community, as hackers seek to exploit uncovered vulnerabilities in software code. Isolate the devices that are the target of threats and apply software patches to them.
        6. Inspect new devices before they connect.
Establish a process for ensuring that new devices, purchased or added, include security features in their hardware, software and network connection, and that the security features are updated.
         7. Demand best practices from your business partners.
Make certain that the business partners that have access to your networks also have strong security programs—and that they demonstrate compliance with your procedures. For example, a repairs contractor, which needs to access connected systems and devices must have implemented security measures such as software updates, and comply with your company’s policies before it can enter your network.
         8. Have backups ready.
A cyber security program for IoT systems fits into a broader corporate risk management program. Incorporate its elements into existing plans for disaster recovery and business continuity already established to deal with a system breach. Include information about IoT security in the company’s incidents communications strategy.
IoT Security in Action: Three Cases
The experiences of three companies we have worked with show how IoT cyber security can work.
Manufacturing firm strengthens its OT security
Situation: At a manufacturing company, executives understood their plant floors had embedded software and Wi-Fi network connections in a typical mix of legacy equipment and newer devices. Such assets included programmable logic controllers (PLCs), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and human-machine interfaces (HMIs) to control industrial processes. The company had other connected devices including equipment for its field support crews, business continuity, and incident management programs.
Actions taken: The company deployed non-invasive software tools designed for IT systems and customized to work with OT network protocols, to scan all of its devices for vulnerabilities. The tools identified vulnerabilities, and the company then repaired them. After finishing this process at one factory, the company repeated the process at other factories.
Takeaway: By applying best information security practices developed for IT systems, this company was able to identify and remediate security risks in its operations. Building on its record, the company was able to monitor its devices and systems, and update its practices to address future vulnerabilities.
Utility establishes OT security roadmap
Situation: Concerned that its IoT devices presented a security risk, leaders at a utility company sought to identify problems and solutions.
Actions taken: The company began a 12- to 18-month assessment of its organization’s security capabilities in addition to its security practices and controls, adapting the ISO 27001 IT standard developed for OT security. Assets evaluated will include controllers, HMIs, asset management systems, as well as equipment for the field service organization. The assessment also will examine how OT security should be included in its incident management plans and business continuity program.
The assessment will identify high-value assets that need immediate attention, as well as other measures the company must execute as part of a comprehensive OT security management plan.
Takeaway: By adapting best security practices for IoT devices, the company is strengthening its risk management posture.
Company establishes security governance program OT
Situation: After performing an IoT security assessment, executives at a utility company sought to develop capabilities to manage cyber security.
Actions taken: The company adapted IT best practices for its OT organization. It defined OT security policies. It established an OT security governance process with defined roles and responsibilities. It set metrics for governance procedures and security actions. It scheduled regular reports for the OT organization to update executives on the security status of its IoT assets.
Takeaway: An OT organization can establish strong information security governance to mitigate IoT security risks.
Manage Risks While Capitalizing on IoT Benefits
In the excitement to take advantage of IoT, companies today must assess the risks of a security breach or loss of control of important operational systems. Firms that demand secured technology will lay a strong foundation for ongoing risk management efforts.
Programs to prevent a security problem—such as updating and patching systems—and procedures to deal with any security disruption will enable companies to prepare for the worst as they seek to make good on the promise of this powerful technology.
Throughout these efforts, executives should ensure that IT and OT devote their experts’ time to collaboration. The CISO should play a role while IT and OT leaders in a central group monitor conditions, follow best practices to mitigate risks that exist, and respond to incidents. A strong cyber security strategy includes continuous testing for, and addressing of, vulnerabilities in IoT devices.

45,"Industries are being reordered today by the confluence of four technologies: cloud computing (which makes supercomputing power affordable even for startup firms), artificial intelligence (which ups the IQ of products, people and processes), big data and analytics (which turn operational chaos into coherency), and the internet of things (which lets us track products, people, customers, and premises around the clock/around the world).
But why do so many companies ignore the transformation that is happening now around them? In their new book, MIT professors Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson argue (as Kuhn did about scientific revolutions) that it is difficult to change long-accepted beliefs. “Existing processes, customers and suppliers, pools of expertise, and more general mindsets can all blind incumbents to things that should be obvious, such as the possibilities of new technologies that depart greatly from the status quo,” they write in Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future.10 It’s why “so many of the smartest and most experienced people and companies … [are] the least able to see” a transformation that they won’t escape.
Is such blindness avoidable? I think so. To do so, senior executives need to sharpen or develop five traits that may have sat dormant in them, but which I think reside in all of us. These traits helped the executives running three of the most successful companies of the last 10 years—Apple, Amazon, and Netflix—rapidly recognize the potential of AI and automation, cloud computing, IoT and big data and how they would transform their businesses. Those traits are:

I’ll explain each trait and why the confluence of the technologies I mentioned puts them at a premium today in the C-suite. To illustrate them, I’m going to show how they played out at Apple, Amazon, and Netflix:

Under Steve Jobs, Apple transformed itself from a failing maker of desktop computers to a mobile device and computer company that has redefined the music, media, photographic and telecommunications industries. Rejoining the company in 1997, 20 years ago when it was nearly bankrupt, Jobs had lifted it to more than $100 billion in annual revenue and a net profit of $26 billion at the time of his death in 2011.2 Since then Apple’s revenue has doubled again, to $214 billion in 2016, under CEO Tim Cook.

Since 2006, Jeff Bezos has been expanding Amazon’s business beyond online retailing to cloud computing services. This year, AWS’ revenue is on track to exceed $16 billion, and its operating income is larger than that of Amazon’s retail business, even though its revenue is eight times greater than AWS’.3 Perhaps better than any other company, Amazon acted early on the convergence of cloud, big data, and automation. Said Werner Vogels, the firm’s CTO: “Amazon Web Services was always considered a business by itself, with the expectation that it could even grow as big as the Amazon.com retail operation.”4

Reed Hastings has presided over two transformations at Netflix: Its switch from distributing movies through the mail to streaming them online, and then getting into movie and TV programming business itself. In 20 years, Netflix has gone from a startup to almost $9 billion in annual revenue, with a market cap in July of nearly $80 billion.5


While the stories of these companies are well-known, the five characteristics that their executives share aren’t as well-understood. Here are those traits, and how they helped their leaders dissect the vast opportunities of a new technological wave.
The Imagination to See What Others Didn’t
Netflix founder Reed Hastings launched Netflix 20 years ago knowing that the technology of that time to distribute movies was going to change dramatically after the proliferation of high-bandwidth Internet networks. In a recent interview with venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Hastings explained that putting DVDs in the mail was a weigh station to a streaming future.6 “We always viewed the DVD by mail as a digital distribution network.” The product–movies encoded in digital form on disks–were in fact digital. When it was technically and economically possible in the last decade for those digits to be shipped online, the Netflix business would need to change. In comparison, his earliest big competitor (Blockbuster) was run by executives who “fell in love with stores,” Hastings says.
Says Hastings, “That’s why we called the company Netflix rather than ‘DVD By Mail’ or that kind of thing. We had the slight advantage that we would not fall in love with our first business.”
Netflix also had the imagination to predict that it couldn’t remain only a movie and TV programming distributor. Cable and telecommunications companies were wiring up their communities with broadband, and they’d be able to distribute the same fare that Netflix could. Netflix had to also be in the “content” business–creating its own TV series. In fact, last year the company spent $5 billion on such programming, and said it would spend another $6 billion on it this year.7
In other words, the top management at Netflix had the imagination to know that they had to transform their offerings beyond renting movies that are produced by other firms. They knew at some point they had to be in the movie and TV show production business too.
All in all, Hastings and his team had the imagination to see where their business was headed, and they acted first. Netflix has more than 100 subscribers now to its video streaming business worldwide, half of whom are outside its U.S. base.8 Blockbuster, which didn’t have the imagination to see and action on the future, is long gone.
Hastings realizes Netflix’s success can be a damper on imagination at his firm. But he knows he can’t fall into the trap. As he said to Andreessen: “The lack of imagination amongst us leaders can be very high. It’s easy to look at guys like [Ken Olsen, the founding CEO of Digital Equipment Corp.] and say, ‘What idiots!’ But, in fact, they are us.”
Jeff Bezos also recently lamented the lack of imagination across industries about the opportunities for companies. He believes big technological trends are easy to identify but “strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.” Bezos pointed recently to a big trend that is “an obvious one right now”–machine learning and artificial intelligence. Amazon has been experimenting with putting machine learning to use for years–for example, in its delivery drones and Alexa cloud-based AI assistant.9
A Voracious Appetite for Compelling and Competing Ideas
The C-suite of any company is not likely to be as imaginative as it needs to be these days if only one person–the CEO–is allowed to do the imagining.
According to Steve Jobs’ appointed biographer, the co-founder of Apple and the firm’s lead transformer of the music, computer, cellphone, and other industries was not some lone inventor who dreamed strong ideas and told others to execute them. He sought out team members with great ideas—and the fortitude to convince him they were right. “I can tell people in a meeting that they’re [wrong], but they can bark back at me and tell me I’m [wrong],” wrote Walter Isaacson in Jobs’ biography.10 “And then we have the most rip-roaring arguments, and that’s why we work together well.”
“We have wonderful arguments. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to be run by ideas, not by hierarchy. The best ideas have to win. Otherwise good people don’t stay.”80
Jobs and his Apple executive team had many heated debates about company strategy, what products to pursue, and so on. But Jobs made sure his ideas didn’t stamp out the concepts of others. Before he died, Jobs told a technology conference that great ideas–and internal debates about them–were paramount in companies, no matter where those ideas came from: “We have wonderful arguments. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to be run by ideas, not by hierarchy. The best ideas have to win. Otherwise good people don’t stay.”11
Great ideas for the future–not those of the past–were what Jobs cared about. Said current CEO Tim Cook, “Another thing Steve taught us all was not to focus on the past. Be future-focused. If you’ve done something great or terrible in the past, forget it and go on and create the next thing.”12
A Relentless Customer Advocate
Jeff Bezos has had a laser focus on investments and improvements that have kept Amazon’s customers loyal and buying even more from the company. As he said in his 1997 letter to shareholders, “We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.”13Amazon’s growth speaks volumes to the promise that Bezos has kept since then.
The way Amazon views the technology convergence that’s now upon us is through the lens of customer value: how can cloud, AI, automation, and IoT help the company generate unprecedented value for its global customers. From the start of his company, Bezos has avoided getting distracted by the technologies swirling around it. As he told a large employee group this spring, “There are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor-focused. You can be product-focused. You can be technology-focused. You can be business-model focused. And there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of [long-term] vitality.”14
Exuding Calmness in the Storm
Tumultuous market changes can distract an executive team. Bezos’ “true north” amidst his company’s technological and competitive storm has always been the customer. Netflix founder Hastings too has found it necessary not to worry incessantly about what competitors are doing, even those with much deeper pockets.
“People say things like ‘only the paranoid survive,’” he said, repeating the title of a book by Andrew Grove, the legendary ex-CEO of Intel.15 “It encodes a truth in a way but it oversimplifies it because paranoid [people] are delusional,” explained Hastings. And when executives get delusional, they “get totally distracted on the wrong threats,” Hastings said.
He should know. When Netflix’s primary business was distributing movie DVDs through the mail, its competitors were much bigger companies with bigger coffers: Blockbuster, Walmart, and others. “Suddenly, we were up against much larger companies. We got through it by not getting psyched out but by focusing on improving service,” Hastings said in his interview.16 “We spend a very small amount of time thinking about the competition and most of the time about improving our service, because there is nothing we can do about the competition.”
That is, Hastings has remained calm no matter how many competitors there are today and on the horizon.
Loyalty to Great People, But Not to Their Current Jobs
One of AI’s greatest challenges for big companies is this: Making sure their most valuable people don’t leave because of the fear their jobs will be automated.
One of the least recognized characteristics of the leaders at Apple, Netflix and Amazon has been their ability to retain valuable people, even if those whose jobs had to shift.
Steve Jobs stayed loyal to the executives who had helped him at Pixar and NeXT. He took many of them with him when he returned to Apple in 1997.17 And many of them stayed as Apple evolved from a computer company to a computer, digital device, smartphone, and music distribution company.
The ability to recognize talent and redeploy it when the work and products of a company must change will be an increasingly important one in a world of AI and automation. Top executives must be unsentimental about the work of the organization that can be improved by being automated or outsourced. However, they must be sentimental to highly valuable people who occupy those jobs and are ready to put their talent into something new.
The five traits of abundant imagination, a hunger for ideas, an unrelenting focus on giving customers more and more, staying calm in the competitive storm, and staying loyal to great people but not to their old jobs are now vital in just about every large company. If you have them, they will go a long way in helping your firm to transform itself and pursue the immense opportunities ahead.

46,"Vijay Govindarajan is the Coxe Distinguished Professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business and a Marvin Bower Fellow at Harvard Business School. He is the author of “The Three Box Solution: A Strategy for Leading Innovation” (HBR Press, April 2016).
Today’s most innovative and successful companies are able to master three boxes, says innovation thought leader Vijay Govindarajan.

In the digital era, companies must get much better at Box 2. Escaping the traps of the past falls within the realm of corporate culture described by many leaders as the hardest part of digital business transformation.
Govindarajan shares ideas with TCS about developing a culture suited to an age of accelerated change.
TCS: Why is it so hard for leaders to escape the traps of the past, even in the digital business age when they are being urged along at high speed?
Vijay Govindarajan: If you cannot forget, you cannot create new things. Yet forgetting is so difficult. What you need to forget still has value today, but it will become a weakness in the future.
The U.S. automobile industry grew up in an era when mechanical engineering was a core competency. In the last couple of years, with autonomous vehicles and the sharing economy, the auto industry is transforming to prioritize computer science, artificial intelligence, and so on. For auto companies to forget that the core competency is mechanical engineering is very difficult, because today their executives still taste success. And today’s success is still based on mechanical engineering. Looking ahead, it is a future weakness.
TCS: What can leaders do to accelerate the pace of ‘culture change’ inside their companies?
Govindarajan: You have to be careful when defining the parts of the company where you want to change the culture. A wholesale change in culture is not needed in all companies. If you go back to the auto industry for a moment, what you want to change is the part of the organization that has to experiment and learn new things such as electric cars or driverless cars. In many instances, you want a selective approach.
TCS: Are there companies that stand out for executing quickly on culture in this digital age?
Govindarajan: The best way to do it is to create a dedicated team focused on bringing about a fundamentally different culture. GE is doing this. GE’s industrial businesses are not going away. But GE is trying to transform itself from an industrial company into an information company. So GE is launching this breakthrough business model based on the Industrial Internet (GE’s term for connected devices). That is a fundamentally different business model when compared to the core business. Therefore, they have created GE Digital where the culture is very different from GE’s core business.
TCS: Could you point out some things that GE is doing right with regard to culture change?
Govindarajan: You do not directly change culture. Culture is an outcome variable. What you do is change the rewards system. You change the kinds of people you hire. GE created a separate team in Silicon Valley. That brings about a culture change. Second, they recruited very different people, in the thousands. They allowed them to have a different process, a much leaner, experimental, adaptive kind of a mindset. They were not held accountable for short-term financial results, but on their ability to test and learn about assumptions. This is how you change the culture. That does not mean the same culture change is happening in the core business.
Create a dedicated team focused on bringing about a fundamentally different culture.
TCS: Yet there are many examples of big companies that set up Silicon Valley teams to bring innovation and culture change to the rest of the company, but which did not work as well. Xerox, which set up its Palo Alto Research Center in the 1970s, was one of them. Xerox PARC created several great personal computing innovations but other companies capitalized on them. So are there any cultural lessons to be learned for GE and others that have been setting up shop in Silicon Valley?
Govindarajan: First, Xerox PARC was just an R&D lab. We should not mistake R&D for creating new businesses or business models. R&D is a source.
Second, Xerox PARC was created as an island and it was not connected to the businesses of Xerox in any rigorous way. Ultimately, the success will come only if you create a dedicated team in Silicon Valley that is strongly connected to the mother ship. In the GE case, GE Digital is strongly connected. That is the only way GE can win against the Silicon Valley startups.
TCS: For companies that have identified the part of the business they want to change, is there such a thing as moving too fast?
Govindarajan: Absolutely. Moving too fast is not doing low-cost, low-risk experiments as a way to understand the territory. Moving too fast is scaling up the new business model without understanding the unknowns. The next big things are always full of unknowns. You can move too fast because you think speed to market is important. Everybody is facing the same set of unknowns. Learn fast, before you move fast.
The need for change has to start at the top.
The other problem is companies try to do too many new things. They jump in and start too many initiatives. That is part of the reasons so many firms fail. If you tell companies “you are doing too much,” it really resonates with them. Not only are resources thinly allocated, you are also letting a lot of projects without promise proceed. Then you throw good money after bad money. You need to spend a little bit, learn, and then spend more.
TCS: What are the techniques or strategies that leaders can use to get their teams to buy into the need for change?
Govindarajan: It really has to start at the top; that is the key. If the CEO does not see that multiple cultures can exist inside the same company, it is not going to happen. The CEO needs to articulate that having different cultures does not mean that one culture is superior to another, it just means that the need is different, and that you require a variety of capabilities, different processes, alternate metrics in one part of the organization. It is communication and more communication.
The best way to communicate may not be to just talk, but also to make other visible statements. Sometimes, you might want to let go of someone who is resisting this kind of culture change, even if that person is a high performer. Letting go of a high performer sends a strong signal that you really believe in the importance of change.
TCS: What we are describing here is a federated model for companies, where you have a core group focusing on the established parts of the business and a separate group focusing on a new business opportunity. Is there a risk to that model?
Govindarajan: That separate group should be strongly connected to the mothership. I am not recommending ‘skunkworks’ projects; they are all mistakes in my opinion. What I am recommending is a distinct team with specific tasks. Skunkworks gives the image of someone working in the basement, subverting the systems. We want people to be collaborative and cooperative.
What is the downside? If not managed properly this can create all kinds of conflict.
TCS: What kinds of connections to the mother ship are we talking about?
Govindarajan: The connections have to be where there is a significant asset in the core business that you can leverage. So if you go back to the GE example, the significant asset is the information that is embedded in the business. The connection between GE Digital and GE Healthcare has to be around machines generating patient data.
TCS: Do many of the companies that were born digital believe they are immune to the Box 2 trap, that they cannot get trapped by the past?
Govindarajan: Yes. Typically, Silicon Valley companies think the three-box framework does not apply to them. But in the pure internet business, someone else’s ability to imitate what you are doing is high. Box 3 (breakthrough ideas) will become Box 1 (current, core business operations) very quickly. That is why they face the Box 2 problem (escaping the traps of the past) even more than industrial companies. They just do not realize it.
That is why Google set up the Alphabet companies, created the separate dedicated teams for driverless cars and robotics, and virtual reality businesses.
TCS: In companies like Google Alphabet, what are the key elements of healthy culture?
Govindarajan: These companies realize there are two types of innovation: linear and non-linear. Linear is to improve your current business. Non-linear is to create new business models. You have to manage both with different processes, metrics, and people. That will result in different cultures too. Accepting that is critical. We must understand that there are two different sets of talents that CEOs need to manage.

47,"In the age of big data, companies have unprecedented access to information on everything from connected IoT products to customer opinions. But collecting large amounts of data and wringing business value from it are two different things—and most companies struggle greatly with the latter.
What is holding companies back from achieving greater ROI? Which aspects of analytics are important looking forward? Which are over-hyped?
To delve into these questions, TCS spoke with Prabhudev Konana, the William H. Seay Centennial Professor of Information Management, and past chairman of the Department of Information, Risk, and Operations Management in the McCombs School of Business at University of Texas at Austin, where he founded the Master of Science in Business Analytics degree program. 
The real analytics struggle for many companies starts at the beginning, says Konana. “Knowing the right business questions to ask as you analyze data is vital. If you do not ask the right questions, you will never realize significant ROI.”
TCS: How do forward-looking companies measure the success of analytics projects and which emerging metrics might be important in a few years time?
Prabhudev Konana: The most important business metric is the basic one: dollars and cents. Many companies are using social media analytics to target the right customers, but at the end of the day, are they converting those potential customers into real customers? That is the biggest missing piece in analytics today: how it affects top-line and bottom-line growth.
Once you answer that question, you can drill down to the more operational level and choose the right metrics to support that growth. For example, if you are dealing with credit card fraud detection, your metrics can gauge whether you are reducing fraud situations or flagging incidents before they happen. If you are looking at security issues, your metrics should be able to detect intrusions and spot potential security violations early.
However, the benefits eventually become elusive when these metrics inevitably become widely used and part of the status quo. For example, competitors might invest in metrics that measure customer retention for the same customer base, so every time that you improve, somebody else improves too. So it has less and less of an impact on the bottom line. But it will hurt you if you do not make the investment in analytics. Companies that have superior analytics capabilities in the marketplace will benefit. Others may perennially play a catch-up game.
TCS: Today companies can tap into a range of data sources—social media, mobile apps, geolocation data, government databases, and news feeds. Which emerging data sources intrigue you?
Konana: The biggest source is going to be the Internet of Things, which is making it possible to collect massive amounts of data, including mobile data from smart cars and driverless cars. Data from the IoT is creating smart homes and we are moving towards smart cities. Healthcare is going to be massive in this area; we will see lots of new interesting data sources coming in.
My problem is that over 90% of companies still have no idea what to do with social media data, mobile data, location data, and so on. We are still learning. IoT is the next big thing, but some companies are still struggling with what to do with Facebook data. We are still trying to master the existing data sources to create value.
TCS: Many business users are frustrated with today’s data analysis dashboards, because they are not terribly usable. Do you have any thoughts on what is coming and if that situation will improve any time soon?
Konana: I think it is going to get better. The old dashboards had problems because they were not fully integrated and companies had to force-fit the information sources. Eventually we are going to see ‘micro-level’ dashboards that are more meaningful; they will show things such as “this is our business target; this is what you will reach; this is how we can get there; this is a shortfall.” You can see these kinds of dashboards appearing at the business unit level and at the corporate level.
Over 90% of companies still have no idea what to do with social media data, mobile data, location data, and so on.
The behavioral side must be managed, though. Dashboards can backfire, because if everything goes well, people may feel complacent, and when things are not going well, they may panic. Having too much information on the dashboard can hurt the morale of the company and the way people work. Nonetheless, dashboards can be powerful.
TCS: Can you share an example of a company that you think is doing a better than average job of getting ROI from its analytics?
Konana: Very few companies come anywhere close to the Amazons and Starbucks of the world, the new-generation companies. Traditional large companies have a tougher time, especially if they need to integrate their analytics for online and offline sales. Comparing internet years and the traditional years is like comparing human years and dog years. A traditional company can spend seven years to develop the degree of integration that a new-generation company can do in one year.
That being said, analytics is still a strategic necessity for any kind of company today, and if you do not do it, you are finished. Best Buy has done an extremely good job in using analytics. While we all focus on the problem of ‘showrooming’ (visiting the Best Buy store and then scouting for the best deal online), Best Buy is investing lots of resources to understand what people are saying, what they might buy, and how they might be influenced. They are using Facebook and other social media very well. Home Depot is another example.
TCS: Visualization technology looks to be an important trend for companies seeking better ways to present data to business users. What do you think?
Konana: Visualization is important, but it is really the last stage of the analytics process, when you are presenting insights to senior management. Before that can happen, people must define what they want from the analytics. A lot of senior managers say that their industry is moving fast and there is lot of hype about visualization, so it is something the company should be doing. However, when you drill down, many companies still do not know what questions to ask.
Along with not being clear on what visualization and analytics should accomplish, senior managers are often disconnected from the talent in the company who can do the actual dirty work of analysis and bring it to them. This is a classic business/IT alignment problem.
TCS: Companies are fighting for scarce analytics talent. How important will it be for companies to train up analytics expertise in-house, in addition to hiring outside analytics talent?
Konana: Analytics by definition is very technical and quantitative, and it gets harder to teach the longer a person has been away from mathematics. Many big-name companies found this out when they tried to bring in people with four or five years experience and make them into analytics specialists. Many of them had forgotten their math because they had not done it for years.
Bringing in people with math skills intact, but with less business experience, brings a different set of problems: They often do not fully grasp the complexities of what needs to be analyzed. Those who understand the math often can not explain how it relates to their company’s or customers’ goals. Sometimes that means completely detaching from all the complexities of the predictive models and explaining something simply. That is not easy to do.
That is why the University of Texas requires students to learn accounting and finance along with analytics. We do this because even though they might do social network analysis, they must be able to relate all these metrics to business growth. These metrics are the ones that count.
TCS: Which aspects of the future of analytics are perhaps overhyped?
Konana: The use of social media is one. Companies have been bragging about using social media, surfing data, and analyzing location data. These are noisy, messy data sets and you need specialized people to be able to do it. I have a feeling that many companies will fail trying to create those capabilities inside the firm.
The real hype is that somehow analytics is going to magically change your business. You still need a well defined strategy, and you have got to use data in order to push your strategy ahead.
TCS: What excites you about the future of analytics?
Konana: Healthcare. Hospitals are trying to analyze data so they can understand for example, drug interactions, or early symptoms. According to a recent New York Times article, Microsoft researchers were able to identify symptoms for cancer by analyzing an individual’s web searches. This could quickly identify people at risk for cancer. The challenge will be embedding healthcare analytics capabilities into tools where people do not really have to understand programming to use the data productively.
Another exciting tool is sentiment extraction; for example, what are people saying about my product? Products are being developed that help companies figure this out without doing massive programming; you just feed the data and the technology has the capabilities to do it.

48,"A globally celebrated advisor to executives at top companies, Ram Charan specializes in practical solutions to the most vexing problems facing industries. For the last four decades, he has worked with CEOs, boards and business unit heads at such companies as General Electric, Bank of America, DuPont, MeadWestvaco, Novartis, EMC, 3M, Verizon, Grupo RBS, and the Tata Group. Jack Welch, GE’s legendary former CEO, says Charan has “the rare ability to distill meaningful from meaningless and transfer it in a quiet, effective way without destroying confidences.”
Named by Fortune magazine in 2007 as the “most influential consultant alive,” Charan is a prolific author of business books—23 since 1998. They have collectively sold more than 3 million copies in more than a dozen languages. “Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done” (co-authored with ex-Honeywell CEO Larry Bossidy) was on The New York Times Best Seller list for more than 150 weeks. It, and two other Charan books, were Wall Street Journal bestsellers.
Charan’s most recent book is titled ‘The Attacker’s Advantage: Turning Uncertainty into Breakthrough Opportunities’ (Public Affairs, 2015). In it, Charan asserts that structural uncertainty—driven most of all by digital technology—will continue to shake even venerable, long-established companies and industries to their foundations. Leaders and their businesses can thrive only if they know how to spot the very beginnings of change—and harness it to their advantage before anyone else does.
Charan discussed these challenges in a recent interview with editors of TCS ‘Perspectives’.
TCS: One of the tenets of your book is that taking control of uncertainty is the fundamental leadership challenge of our time. Why is this so important today?
Ram Charan: Structural uncertainty in every industry is happening much more frequently than ever before. It is quite different from the seasonal and even cyclical uncertainty that companies have learned to manage. Structural uncertainty can come from surprising places. It can explode the existing structure of your marketplace and your industry, and it can eliminate companies that do not anticipate it and deal with it well.
Leaders must expect uncertainty. But even more, they need to know how to take advantage of it.
Human beings create almost all structural uncertainties. And the seeds of that uncertainty are there, in the present and the past, but they are very difficult to detect. You must focus hard to see it and understand who is behind it. You must anticipate the forces that might enable these seeds of uncertainty to take hold and become big and unstoppable.
One of the classic examples of this is the structural uncertainty that Steve Jobs and Apple created for Nokia. In the early 2000s, Nokia was the No. 1 mobile phone maker in the world and had patents on its handsets. Before it unleashed its first iPhone in June 2007, Apple had been filing patents on it, in fact more than 200.
Despite the publicly available information, the Nokia leadership team just didn’t believe a computer company could be a threat to their cellphone business. As a result, Nokia didn’t prepare itself quickly enough for Apple’s onslaught. Had Nokia been prepared, it would have recognized that change was coming and positioned itself to ride the change rather than be engulfed by it.
TCS: Which structural uncertainty presents the biggest single threat to established companies?
Charan: Today, the most unstoppable uncertainty for most legacy companies is the onslaught of digital companies that use algorithms. ‘Born digital’ companies—Google, Facebook, Amazon—are experts in algorithms, which are sets of rules that tell computers what to do with data that has been converted into numeric digits. Algorithms, and their related software, can process huge amounts of data and predict the outcomes of decisions with multiple variables at lightning speed.
This is the new game. What I call the algorithmic revolution is as important to shaking up industry structures as the internal combustion engine was in the mid-1800s. No company will escape it. Companies that have these mathematical capabilities will thrive; those that delay or rail against the new reality will be punished badly, as Nokia, Motorola, and Kodak were.
TCS: So do legacy firms have an inherent disadvantage over the born digitals?
Charan: The greatest disadvantage of legacy companies is their mindset and their lack of courage to do what they need to do. They actually have an advantage that born-digital companies lack: domain knowledge and the expertise needed to service the customer. Domain needs are serviced best by legacy companies; it is much harder for born-digital companies to do. Some leaders of legacy companies understand this and use it to their advantage. Others never will.
TCS: In ‘The Attacker’s Advantage,’ you talk about five skills you believe leaders must possess to be able to see the big bends in the road: perceptual acuity, a mindset to see opportunity and uncertainty, the ability to see a new path forward and commit to that new path, adeptness in managing the transition to that new path, and skills in making an organization steerable and agile. Can you say a little bit about each one, starting with perceptual acuity?
Charan: Because people create the future and it is easy and inexpensive to access the internet, more than 7 billion people today can express themselves, take action, create innovations, and shake up an industry. This means that all companies must build the ability to see over the horizon, and predict which of the existing seeds of uncertainty will take hold and reshape the future. We have to practice this perceptual skill constantly so it will improve.
TCS: What about the second skill: the mindset to see opportunity and uncertainty? What kind of mindset is necessary?
Charan: Uncertainty can be a negative if your mindset is pessimistic. The best leaders see uncertainty as a great opportunity. The smart phone was a great opportunity for somebody, and a problem for somebody else. So the question everybody should ask is: I can see the uncertainty, but if I were not in this business how would I make money from it?
TCS: Your third element is the ability to see a new path forward and commit to it. What are the most important elements to doing that?
Charan: A business exists to discover a customer’s need, and fill it. Leaders must discover how an uncertainty will reshape that need, and find a new path to filling it—something that will create benefit for the customer and make money for the business. The new path might require designing and delivering a current need in a new way, or filling a different need altogether.
Uncertainty changes the landscape, and that landscape might create a new need, or maybe a different need, or maybe the same need addressed in a different way. A CEO who cannot see this or respond to it will have difficulties.
TCS: And what about the fourth skill: adeptness in managing this transition to the new path? In your book, you talk about having two tracks: one, to make sure you do not mismanage your current business, but the other, to build your new business at the same time.
Charan: This is the new challenge for most CEOs. First, they have got to realize how fast their existing business will decline if they do not do digitization and algorithms. If they do not move quickly, they will have nothing left, or will have so little left that they cannot come back. They need to see how quickly they must add these capabilities and figure how they can get the resources to fund it. They also must manage the existing business so they do not accelerate its demise.
Now the positive news is that legacy companies know their customers and have an embedded base. They must simply find a way to create a need that they can satisfy, and redefine the end-to-end customer experience. Before, they needed only to produce a product and use the linear system of distributors, wholesalers and other channels to get it to market.
Now you have got to think imaginatively about the whole experience of the customer and the other players involved from start to finish. The companies that can do that—and that use the power of digitization and algorithms—are going to make it.
TCS: So let us talk about the fifth skill: making an organization steerable and agile.
Charan: Here is an analogy: Cars and airplanes are steerable, and they are designed that way. But most companies steer their strategies and goals only once a year, as if the sun rises on January 1st and goes down December 31st; in between is a lot of rigidity, especially when it comes to budgets and people.
Companies must be able to respond more quickly within their yearly strategic planning cycle to changes that take place on the outside—in how they allocate budgets, how they define what people do and design incentives for them, and in the key performance indicators they use. They must have the levers in place that let them steer quickly when needed.
TCS: You mention in your book that it is a sin that the most talented people in a company often are not allowed to move from their division, product line, or function to other areas of that company that actually need them more, to make the company more steerable. Tell us more about that.
Charan: This happens a lot. And because of the fast exponential change on the outside, that rigidity is a negative. Big companies should not allow their most valuable employees to be locked up within divisions or business units. Key talent should be seen as a pool, and the CEO must be convinced to put policies in effect that make it easier to move that talent around, using either pull or push incentives.
At GE, under Jack Welch, top management would review their divisions twice a year. They knew where the top performers were, and they moved the talent when necessary. It was not up to the division heads. That policy has been in place for 35 years, and there is not much resistance because if one division head gives up a talent, he or she also gets one. It is not a net loss. They are giving and receiving.
TCS: Among big global companies, is GE fairly unique about that system and its ability to very quickly deploy talent across geographies and divisions?
Charan: GE has the best system, but Unilever also does it. They know the value of it.
TCS: On this topic of navigating uncertainty to uncover breakthrough opportunities, is there anything else we should think about?
Charan: If you ask people their opinion of another company or industry, they make very good observations, but they cannot see their own that clearly.
All leaders and managers need to look at their world from the outside in. Most of them have grown inside out. If you look at the world inside out, your lens has a very narrow scope. If you look from the outside into your business, your lens is broader. If you do not practice that, you will suffer.

49,"Bruce Temkin is managing partner of the Temkin Group, a Newton, Massachusetts-based research, consulting, and training firm that helps companies become more customer-centric. Prior to launching Temkin Group, he was a vice president at Forrester Research for nearly 12 years, where in his last years there, he focused on customer experience, creating the firm’s Customer Experience Index rankings and earning the most-read analyst title for 13 consecutive quarters.
                                                                                                               
TCS: You’ve spoken about four core competencies for a superior customer experience: purposeful leadership, compelling brand values, customer connectedness, and employee engagement. Why do you believe they are instrumental?
Bruce Temkin: There is a compelling reason for each one. Look at purposeful leadership. Our work is geared towards large organizations. If an organization has tens of thousands of people, it’s really important that everyone is heading in the same direction.
Purposeful leadership is about having leaders who share a compelling view of the future and their values so everyone in the organization makes consistent decisions. It’s an attitude to the effect of “I’ll explain why we’re heading somewhere and show you where we’re aiming to go,” and hopefully all the people in the organization follow.
With a clear purpose, you get alignment, and that makes for a powerful organization.
TCS: What companies do you consider to be exemplary in purposeful leadership?
Temkin: You see purposeful leadership in individual leaders, not just in organizations. But USAA is one company where the values are well understood across the organization. No one questions that the organization is committed to making decisions that are consistent with its mission of helping members of the U.S. military and their families attain financial security.
USAA’s leaders make decisions that are consistent with those values all the time. That’s another element of purposeful leadership: It’s not just about saying, “We’re heading here, our customers are important, and we operate this way.” Purpose truly shines through when an organization makes decisions that are consistent with that mission—even when making them is difficult.
TCS: What about compelling brand values?
Temkin: A lot of people have misconceptions about what customer experience really is. You often hear that you must “wow” the customer with every interaction. While that sounds great, it’s not possible given that no one has unlimited resources. So what’s really important is that we create the experiences that live up to our brand. That means defining a set of promises to customers, and prioritizing efforts around keeping those promises.
TCS: People are so quick to comment on social media about a negative customer experience. It seems easy for companies to say they have to wow customers at every touchpoint or the negative stuff will go viral. Is it difficult for companies to hold to even a minimal standard for the customer experience when a brand can be so easily tarnished?
Temkin: The ability to share bad experiences across a wider audience through social media is something that you never would have had to deal with 10 years ago.
But the principles for dealing with those issues haven’t changed. Every large organization is going to have some customers who have a bad experience. Customer-centric organizations recognize when something doesn’t match their values or brand. Then they rapidly rectify those issues and work quickly to keep them from affecting other customers.
Understanding who we are as a company transcends any individual interaction, whether it is a great one or a bad one. I’ll make a recently relevant example to make the point. Let’s say that an airline has a belligerent passenger who is disturbing everyone, and its employees are able to politely convince him to get off the plane. If that passenger complains, that is not a bad thing. The airline did something consistent with its brand values, which was to not allow one passenger to disrupt everyone else.
Even though you might get a bad tweet and bad press, that shouldn’t move you away from your values. Knowing where to focus your energy doesn’t mean that you serve people terribly outside of key moments. But you don’t need to wow them in every single instance.
TCS: So social media makes the brand values more important, right?
Temkin: Yes. It also forces you to move quickly but keep from overreacting to situations. If someone has a bad experience with your company, you want employees and customers to think, “You know, that doesn’t sound like the company I’ve dealt with.”
If they think that way, then they’ll discount what they hear on social media, since they don’t believe it’s indicative of who that company is.
Companies that are customer-centric also earn a lot more forgiveness. That helps them stay consistent with their brand values even when there are individual incidents.
There are two components. One is having a continual flow of information about what customers are seeing, thinking, and feeling—not just once from some survey you send out every year. The other is basing decisions on that information.
TCS: What does ‘customer connectedness’ mean?
Temkin: Customer connectedness is about making sure that insights about customers are driving decisions across the organization. There are two components: One is having a continual flow of information about what customers are seeing, thinking, and feeling—not just once from some survey you send out every year. The other is basing decisions on that information.
Lots of companies have elaborate ‘voice of the customer’ programs and dashboards full of data. But they don’t act on the insights they have.
They behave as if the constraint is getting data about customers. The more difficult thing is having an organization that is prepared, ready, and able to change its way of doing things based on the insights it gets—that is, putting in place nimble operations so that when a company learns something about customers, it can quickly do something about that insight.
One technology company that we’re working with has a lean development process, where it breaks product releases into shorter development cycles. The company applied that mentality across the organization. Every six weeks it kicks off a new customer experience improvement process based on the top three customer insights its managers have learned over the previous six weeks. This creates an organizational ‘muscle’ for change. It also forces the company to actively and continuously examine customer feedback.
TCS: Let’s move to your fourth competency: employee engagement. You’re very careful to differentiate it from the employee experience. Tell us why.
Temkin: Anything you’re trying to do in a large organization is very difficult, but it will be impossible if employees aren’t engaged. And by engaged, we mean that they are committed to the success of the organization.
When people use the term ‘employee experience,’ they’re often focused on making the work environment positive. I’m not saying this is a bad thing, but it should not be an organization’s ultimate goal with employees.
Companies must create an environment where their employees commit their energy and passion to the success of the organization. If you just focus on employee experience, you can end up with entitled employees, but they’re not necessarily engaged. They come to work because they believe there is an implicit deal that their employer is going to give them all this fun stuff, and their part of the deal is merely showing up.
Employee engagement is about having a richer implicit agreement with your employees. The company will create an environment that allows you to be successful as an individual, and satisfy your intrinsic needs for a sense of meaningfulness, choice, competence, and progress. In return, the company expects employees to help the organization be successful overall. This is a journey for most companies.
TCS: Which technologies should companies stay on top of in the years ahead because they are going to have a big impact on customer experience?
Temkin: I’d start with something relatively simple: text analytics and natural language processing (NLP). There is only so much you can learn from customers through their answers to multiple choice survey questions. Text analytics, in combination with speech analytics, provides the ability to gather insights about customers that come in unstructured ways, such as from the call center and comments on surveys.
Companies must create an environment where their employees commit their energy and passion to the success of the organization.
Meanwhile, voice as an interaction channel is growing. Whether it’s the Xfinity remote, or the Amazon Echo or Google Home, people want to interact with the world in a way that they are most comfortable. And we are all trained on how to use a voice interface from an early age; it’s called ‘talking.’ Companies need to use NLP to create interfaces that leverage voice, but also figure out how to act based on what people say.
That gives rise to predictive analytics. As companies gain more meaningful data from newly mined unstructured sources like voice and text, and as they combine it with the growing amount of structured data, their ability to understand and predict what customers need—and to act on that—is going to grow.
Not only are the analytics technologies getting better, companies are also getting better behavioral data, whether it’s from the digital footprints people leave, or the customer data they collect. Predictive analytics models operate much more effectively when they can provide rich near-term data, rather than relying on a thin layer of historical data.
Lastly, the Internet of Things will give people more control and information to manage their lives. This technology is going to advance much more quickly than it will be adopted by individuals. Consumers will adopt devices like the Echo more quickly than other devices, because coming home and asking for the weather is something people already ask of other people. People tend to more quickly engage in behaviors that they’re familiar with.

50,"Ric Merrifield is a thought leader and an independent consultant who has worked at companies such as Microsoft and Accenture over the last 20 years in studying the impact of digital technologies on the customer experience and the IT architectures of major companies. His landmark 2008 Harvard Business Review article (“The Next Revolution in Productivity”)1 was a manifesto on how service-oriented architectures were beginning to change the rules of digital competition. Based in Seattle, Merrifield has published four articles in the Harvard Business Review in all, as well as a book (Rethink: A Business Manifesto for Cutting Costs and Boosting Innovation; Pearson FT Press, 2009). His most recent writings are about how companies are using the Internet of Things technologies to reengineer customer experience. In 2016, Merrifield delivered a TEDx2 talk about how technology will help improve the quality of life.
TCS: How consequential do you feel the Internet of Things (IoT) will be on the ways companies design customer experiences? Is IoT bigger than CRM in this regard? Is it bigger than smartphones?
Ric Merrifield: I was heavily involved in CRM in the early days, back in the late 1990’s when you had to explain what customer relationship management meant. At the time, it was a revolutionary way for companies, especially their salespeople, to keep track of customers. But even today, CRM remains very transactional in the sense that you track prospects, you get an order, and you support them after the sale.
With CRM, you collect data about customers at episodic touch-points—the times that your salespeople, marketing department, or call center interacted with them. The reason is that they allow your company to get a much more extensive understanding of the end-to-end experience that the customer has with your product—not just your experience with them in your marketing, sales, and service transactions.
You have richer context in terms of not only why they buy or don’t buy, but how happy they are throughout the course of using your product or service. When they become unhappy with your offering, you can respond to that long before they stop using it. And as you collect all of this data, it helps you to be smarter when you sell to the next customer. CRM systems to date really haven’t gathered this type of information.
I think IoT-enabled customer experience management is going to be much bigger thanCRM—especially experiences that are enabled by IoT technologies such as digital bracelets and wireless sensors.
As the repository of information grows, and companies get clearer about their customers’ motivations for purchase and how they’re using the products, customer experience management will be much bigger than CRM.
TCS: Over the last 10 years, you’ve consulted with Starbucks, Walt Disney World, Nordstrom, and other companies on their customer experience initiatives. Knowing that you can only say so much about them, what larger lessons have you drawn from them for all companies that are managing, or planning to launch major customer experience initiatives—often a part of what many companies today are calling their ‘digital transformation’?
Merrifield: If you have information about their past experiences, you can infer their preferences from those experiences. For example, are they focused on price or speed of service or whether they’re looking for a certain product or service that they can’t get anywhere else? Those insights will help you make better suggestions now that they’re on your premises again.
Once you detect that a customer has walked onto your premises (whether it’s a restaurant, store, theme park, bank branch, or other location), if you have historical information about their past experiences with your firm, what should you offer to them now?
The message to a price-focused Starbucks customer might be, “Hey, you can save $.50 on your vanilla latte today.” Or if you’re the customer looking for something different, it might be “Hey, we have a new pumpkin scone that you might like to try with your vanilla latte.”
All to say, you don’t always have to lower your price in delivering a personalized message to a customer to increase the value that they get from you. That is a key learning from customer experience data: It’s not always about giving people discounts or better deals; it’s about figuring out what they like and want so that the message resonates with them and you can both waste less time on messages that aren’t going to make sense for them. When you make an experience exclusive, or in some way personalize it, certain customers will even pay more.
Until now, there used to be a lot of guess work about this. When somebody walked in your store, your store clerks had to look at them and judge—Is this person here to spend money or just walk around and kill time? Do they want to grab a pair of bargain shoes and get out of here or do they want to have someone cater to them, walk all the different aisles and show them what’s new? Ten people who just walked in your door may have very different goals. And unless you recognized the customer from a prior visit, you had no clue about what he or she was there for now.
Now, with customer experience management data, a department store should know the second you walk in that you bought a belt online last week from their site. They might figure you’re looking to buy a pair of slacks or shoes to go with it.
By the way, the best retail organizations are paying great attention to group behaviors at different days of the week and times of the day. At 9:00 AM, they may get a very different mix of customers than what they get at lunch or at 3:00 PM or 6:00 PM. And many of these retailers are putting products and displays on wheels so they can move them around at different times of day to appeal to different customers and customer behavior.
TCS: Many customer experience initiatives are monumental projects. Disney spent an estimated $1 billion on its initiative at Walt Disney World. Other companies are spending in the hundreds of millions on their digital transformation initiatives. Does this mean a large company always needs to spend a huge amount to get something tangible in return for some IoT-enabled customer experience initiative?
Merrifield: Not at all. What doesn’t always make headlines is that Starbucks and Disney both started with very practical business objectives and relatively modest goals for what they initially wanted to accomplish.
Disney and Starbucks had a couple of known problems that they wanted to solve. The customer experience problem Disney solved at Disney World was that people didn’t know that there are more days’ worth of things to do at Disney World than a typical visit would cover. So it ultimately started as an education project. It created a ‘My Disney Experience’ portal to help people learn why they should stay longer. And the key to that was removing the obstacles to making them wait in lines. So the Magic Band, a digital bracelet, became an enabling technology that allowed people to redeem the entitlements that they had created through the My Disney Experience portal. It was never about increasing demand—getting more people to go visit the park. It was always about extending the duration of the stay of people planning to go.
Starbucks’ goal of improving the store experience was similar: reducing long lines. It realized that sometimes the line is very long. But either way, many people don’t want to wait in line. The company wanted to allow customers to place an order and set their expectation about when it’s going to be ready so that the cup of coffee doesn’t get cold. Whether they’re coming in for speed of service or a price or a Starbucks product they can’t get anywhere else, Starbucks didn’t want them to wait in line to be served.
It turned out, and it’s no secret now, that Starbucks unlocked billions of dollars of revenue a year by using digital technologies to shorten the lines—that it has a class of customer who it wasn’t serving well: those people who saw the long line of cars waiting to go through the drive through and then decided to go somewhere else, or a long line in the store, and walked back out again. It was a much bigger problem than Starbucks initially realized.
That is a really sound place to start. If you know you’ve got a problem or an opportunity to serve more customers than you’re serving today, or there’s an education gap where they don’t know something about your products and services, then that is a great place to start.
You’ve got to start with a practical business case that will deliver value. But for most organizations, investing hundreds of millions or billions of dollars isn’t going to be the right place to start unless there is clear business value.
What value do you provide to customers that will keep them coming back for more?
TCS: So even if it starts small, what kinds of barriers should companies expect to face in making a meaningful improvement in its customer experience?
Merrifield: One is a lack of expertise internally for doing much of this work. A team of technology people who have become great at managing servers, networks, help desks, and so on may see the technologies of customer experience as one more new technology they can learn and master.
It’s not so easy. Things like customer experience journey mapping are hard and different from what most people in companies do on a day-to-day basis. It may look easy, but it’s not. Starbucks did most of its work in house. That won’t be the right decision for all companies.
Having people who have done this before, who understand why it’s hard, know how to not only define the scope but also how to develop the technology and test it, roll it out, and sustain it—those are all pretty hard things to do. Stringing them all together successfully is really hard.
But it all needs to begin with a sound business case. Copycatting someone else is risky. Your business case must answer this question: What value do you provide to customers that will keep them coming back for more?
TCS: What about the role of top management in these initiatives. Are they that important to success?
Merrifield: Yes, and for more reasons than you might realize. To set the right tone, the CEO usually needs to be involved, and not just because a company may have to write a big cheque. Customer experience initiatives such as the ones I’ve been involved in can collapse under their own weight of popularity. By this, I mean people will want to take credit and be involved—and it may turn out that they shouldn’t be involved because it takes fresh thinking and can threaten people’s empires. Some very powerful people may therefore get their feelings hurt.
And the CEO is just going to have to step in and say, “This is how we’re going to deliver value in the future.” Politics can kill these initiatives. Companies will need oversight and governance of these initiatives as they surface the politics of the organization.
It’s why customer experience transformations are better done by a stand-alone team (as Disney World did), or by a separate entity such as a joint venture. In either case, they need to report to the CEO or head of the business. Making it a stand-alone project will speed it up and reduce the risk of counterproductive slowdowns that happen when it’s a functionally focused initiative run by people as a side job.

51,"Jeanne Ross serves as research director and principal research scientist for MIT’s Center for Information Systems Research (CISR). She has researched and written extensively on digital strategy and digital business and co-authored three books, most recently, “IT Savvy: What Top Executives Must Know to Go from Pain to Gain” (2009).
According to her research, companies pursuing successful digital strategies need to build both an efficient, integrated operational backbone, and a more fluid digital services backbone—a technology environment where small experiments can come and go. She also stresses the value of ongoing organizational redesign. 
TCS spoke to Ross about those concepts and what she believes established companies that were not ‘born digital’ can do to increase speed in the digital business era.
TCS: What organizational factors feed into a speed disadvantage for companies that were not born digital? 
 How can they move more at the speed of digital natives?
Jeanne Ross: I do not think they can move as fast as newer, smaller companies. But I do not think that is a big handicap because they bring different strengths to the table. That said, they do need to move faster than they have historically. But they have a base of capital—and an ability to scale—that the fledgling digital companies do not have yet.
For a big, established company the question is how do we derive enough value from our heft? How do we draw advantage from our size, our experience, and our relationships? Simultaneously, how do we get a lot faster than we are?
TCS: What are the biggest roadblocks for these companies once they decide to get faster?
Ross: The number one limiting factor is they have not fully become IT-enabled. They have not automated to the extent they can. They still have legacy processes that hold them back.
For a well-managed company that has automated, the new challenge is to make digital innovation happen all over the company. These companies’ tradition is focused innovation, often in an innovation unit. In a digital world, you want as many people innovating as you can. You start distributing innovation to more people, in more places, at more levels of the organization. In the course of doing their jobs, they introduce innovations that lead to better outcomes. A lot of the big old companies do not have a culture or governance process that would allow this, without chaos.
TCS: Do digital businesses take a fundamentally faster approach to building–and improving as necessary–their operational backbone, their mission critical systems?
Ross: Frankly, most digital start-ups are not thinking about their operational backbone. They are focused on building digital products and services, and they build a digital services backbone for that purpose. But as they grow, they will struggle with scale, completing transactions, and back office processes. The exceptions to that rule are companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. As they have grown, they have built an operational backbone, and it has facilitated their growth. But even those companies have turned out a little different than they imagined when they started.
Digitally born companies had an advantage because they did not have some of the older systems, but they definitely have faced the challenge of speed–creating inefficiencies and challenges to building an operational platform.
First, you are moving so fast you cannot fix things that did not fit. You can create chaos in your systems and processes. Second, you are incredibly profitable, which makes it less important to introduce the efficiencies that your operational backbone offers. When you are older and your growth slows, you have a financial incentive to focus on efficiency and processes.
TCS: You note the value of ongoing organizational redesign to a digital business. What strategies can leaders of companies not born digital use to build team support for this idea?
Ross: The more you introduce an environment in which jobs are continually changing, the better. I think of USAA [the Fortune 500 financial services company]: every time you talk to them, people’s jobs have changed. What that starts to do, is give people a much broader sense of what the company is trying to accomplish. People are constantly learning and they are constantly challenged.
The idea is ‘We are going to change tomorrow. Come in expecting to change.’ That is the culture you want to foster–and it is not typical.
Move people around a lot, and then give them clear assignments and a clear idea of what the business needs to accomplish. In an environment like that, people do not worry about job security because this is the norm. It is important to get accountability and empowerment right if you want to succeed in establishing a culture of change.
TCS: That is a big leap of faith for employees to make, it is it not? How do the companies pull it off?
Ross: Yes. The hardest part is where to start. The first few people you tap, you pick people who are not risk averse and have energy for this kind of thing. If you have had a stable environment, this will be disarming for people. You want senior executives saying “We need to do this”, and asking “what do we not know.” What do we not know about a given customer, product or technology and how do we learn it?
That is the kind of culture companies will have to adopt. It is what startups do without realizing it. As people grow, their jobs change, and it is very natural. You are trying to create excitement for identifying the next opportunity. That will be hard. Start with a few people you have confidence in, and it will grow.
As a rule, companies are not good at this, but you have to keep trying.
TCS: In the digital business age, the traditional ‘divide and conquer’ approach to organizational design is being replaced with more horizontal teams, where processes and roles flow across business units. Is this a ‘nice to have’ or a ‘must have’ for companies seeking speed?
Ross: It is a must have. The thing that is causing the biggest problem is the need to integrate data. You cannot just put a fancy front end on something and go. Mobility is so critical to digital. If the data is not integrated, people must insert themselves into what ought to be automated processes.
Divide and conquer allows people to operate in silos. Each function or line of business figures out what must be done and divides up the necessary tasks to achieve that. To integrate across those silos, you rely on hierarchy—push issues up and instructions and information will trickle back down. With digital, there is no time for that.
TCS: What traits prove important for leaders of ‘fast’ digital companies?
Ross: The single most important thing is they can shut out the noise. They say “What is our biggest issue today and let us get it resolved”. I am thinking about the CEO of Lego. In 2004 he recognized that their biggest problem was supply chain, and he formed cross-functional teams to solve it. Within a year, it made a difference. Within three years, it was really good, and the company’s performance had turned around.
These leaders understand that this is our biggest problem, and solving that problem will facilitate immediate improvements and long-term capabilities. Meanwhile, other things will not get fixed. The important thing is to get started, to create capability that leads to more capabilities. It is about being able to leverage multiple parts of your organization. Get on the road. Once you get going, it is easy to pick up speed. The way you are reducing the noise is focusing on the more fundamental problem and going after it.
TCS: Why is a digital services backbone–a technology infrastructure area where companies can develop digital offerings that may be highly valuable for only short periods of time—key to speed?
Ross: The digital services backbone is what makes you fast. It lets you try something and then say “skip that, I have a better idea”. It is not an upgrade to your operational backbone. Think about the app store model here. There are many apps that are not any good; the bad ones go away organically. With your digital services backbone, you really can say “We are going to do this app or UI today, and if we come up with a better one tomorrow, the old one goes away”.
Lately we have been talking about the digital services backbone as a coral reef. It builds and builds, mostly through small organic additions. Little parts decay.
This digital services backbone lets you grow in unpredictable ways. Lego was the first one that described this to me. Lego’s goal, its vision, is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow. That means they want Lego fans to collaborate with anyone who is building. So Lego decided, “We should let them design their own interface. There are so many ways to engage Lego fans and builders. We want these ideas to grow organically.”
TCS: You have noted that a digital service backbone and the teams designing and using it will require new skills–some of which are not clear yet. How do smart companies address this tough talent challenge?
Ross: They are really struggling with that. What we have learned so far is that people are probably overreacting to the talent concern. I would focus first on how we equip and develop the people we have.
It is absolutely true that the kind of talent we need is changing. But we should not panic and hire people with fancy titles without a clear understanding of what we need them to do. Start by making your people more evidence-based. Give them problems to solve and make them figure out what they need to solve them. Be sure you know what problem you are solving before you hire people to solve it. It is easy to hire a chief digital officer, for example. But it is hard for that person to succeed if the company has not been explicit about its digital strategy and convinced everyone to get on board with the transformation.
Start by looking at your operations: Are metrics clear? Are business rules clear? Can we test them? It is about assigning new accountabilities. Break things up so people know what they are accountable for, and have what they need to pull it off. If you start at the bottom of the company, it is very doable. We are seeing some companies that have got their heads around this. They are dividing an end-to-end process into services. They look for constant improvements as a result.
The talent issue is a bit of a red herring. We have not designed our companies to make the most of talent and develop it.
TCS: That sounds like it will require big changes in the hiring process. Are companies capable of doing it?
Ross: It is very addressable. Only a few people have to really understand this.
For example, Google talks about people operations not HR. In a lot of the startups, you have a manager and a coach. Those kinds of things are being adopted. I imagine it moves into recruiting pretty quickly. How long will it take and how good at it will companies get? Good question.
TCS: Are many companies still too focused on operational backbone, to the detriment of their digital services backbone?
Ross: A lot of companies talk about, “We built our platform for supply chain, but now we have to have a platform for manufacturing”. And they go on and on with these platforms. Those platforms can add value to a company but they lead to incremental improvements to the operational backbone, which only offers efficiency not innovation.
You do not help the company grow if you focus only on your operational backbone because you grow through innovation. There is a risk of just doing more of what you are good at. It will generate diminishing returns. It must be complimented by a digital services backbone. That has been a real issue for big companies that like control and order. It is not that they will not get value, but it does not take them into the digital economy.

52,"Michael A. Cusumano1 is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more than 30 years, he has conducted research and taught classes on software company strategy, product development and entrepreneurship, as well as (early in his career) manufacturing and product development methods in the automobile and consumer electronics industries.
He has published 13 books and more than 120 articles and columns on these topics. His latest book (Strategy Rules: Five Timeless Lessons from Bill Gates, Andy Grove and Steve Jobs, published with David Yoffie in 2015) has been translated into 17 languages and received widespread media acclaim. He has also lectured and consulted to nearly 100 organizations around the world.
In the last two years, Professor Cusumano had been on leave from MIT and served as VP and Dean at the Tokyo University of Science. Because of his extensive studies over the last four decades on software development, product development, manufacturing, and (more recently) software business strategy, he possesses unique insights on technology and technology-based business strategy and product development.
TCS: Your research on lean management practices dates back more than 30 years. Can you tell us about the genesis of lean thinking?
Michael Cusumano: As part of my doctoral thesis on the Japanese automobile industry, and eventually for a book I published (The Japanese Automobile Industry: Technology and Management at Nissan and Tokyo, Harvard University Press, 1985), I analyzed the Toyota production system in the 1980s. I studied their productivity at the company level—units [outputs] per company as well as value-added—and I adjusted for things such as labor hours, capital investment, and capacity utilization. Toyota was producing vehicles with half the number of people [used by the American companies], but with the same amount of capital equipment. That was interesting.
So what was ‘lean’ at that time was the number of people.
Then, a student of mine—John Krafcik, who was working on his master’s thesis here at the MIT Sloan School— studied the Japanese production system at a more abstract level. John took this thinking to the assembly plant level: What was productivity like there? What degree of automation did they have in the assembly plants? What management practices did they use?
A number of us here at MIT worked on this research and debated what was the right term to describe these management practices we saw at Toyota. John came up with the term ‘lean.’ Today, he is CEO of Google’s automobile self-driving subsidiary, Waymo. At that time (1988), John published a companion article to mine (on Japanese manufacturing innovations) in the MIT Sloan Management Review called ‘The Triumph of Lean.’2
That started the whole thing. Since then, lean has been applied to everything under the sun. But the original idea was doing roughly the same amount of work in terms of having the same number of outputs or products, with much leaner staff.
A book that came out in 1990, The Machine That Changed the World3 by the three co-directors at the time of MIT’s International Motor Vehicle Program, James Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos] documented that the Japanese car makers were assembling cars in less than half the time the U.S. manufacturers were—12 hours vs. 25 hours.
TCS: By the mid-1990s, your research began focusing on product development in the automotive sector. Tell us more about that.
Cusumano: One of my doctoral students at the time (Kentaro Nobeoka) and I studied automotive product development. An earlier study by two of our colleagues (Kim Clark and Takahiro Fujimoto, who published the research in their book Product Development Performance), found U.S. automobile companies were generally taking 60 to 64 months to develop a new vehicle. The Japanese were pretty close to a 48-month schedule and doing it with about two-thirds the engineering hours.
But we had identified a problem in our research in the mid-1990s: The Japanese automakers had become in many ways too lean. They weren’t sharing much technology across projects within the same company.
Their heavyweight projects might appear lean if you look at them individually. But if you look at a company with a portfolio of products, the Japanese heavyweight project management teams were too self- contained. They weren’t sharing very much. So it was actually becoming expensive for them to develop new automobiles. Nobeoka and I wrote more about that in our 1998 book4(Thinking Beyond Lean).
TCS: So then you shifted your research on automotive manufacturing and product development to the software industry. Tell us more about that.
Cusumano: I actually shifted my major research emphasis to software engineering even before I published my first book in 1985 on the Japanese automobile industry. Large-scale software development became my main focus from 1984.
When I wrote my doctoral thesis at Harvard in the early 1980s, it was clear to me that the next future challenge for Japanese companies would be writing software. In a post-doctoral project I did at Harvard Business School from 1984 to 1986, half of my time I spent studying consumer electronic projects with a Harvard professor, Richard Rosenbloom, and the other half I spent studying Japanese ‘software factories’—i.e., largely how the big Japanese computer manufacturers such as Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi developed their software.
Then I published a book in 1991— called Japan’s Software Factories—on who started the factory idea, how they evolved, and so on. The Japanese essentially copied how U.S. computer manufacturers like IBM ran their own software development centers in the 1970s and 1980s, because the Japanese companies were mostly making IBM-mainframe compatible hardware and software. I got interested in the question of whether Japanese companies could apply the expertise they had accumulated in manufacturing and engineering—quality control, project management, and so on—to large-scale industrial software.
I found most were taking IBM approaches to software development. There was nothing lean about it, by the way. It was almost the complete opposite of lean or what we would today call agile.
TCS: So it was true waterfall approaches to software development?
Cusumano: It was very waterfall. However, Japanese software developers were good at quality. But they didn’t have a good business model for making money from the software itself. They were essentially selling hardware like IBM had done for many years, building operating systems and some applications. But they didn’t really know how to make money from software.
After this study came out in 1991, from being very interested in software and the new personal computers, I decided to ‘follow the money,’ as I like to say. Who was actually making money from software? It was Microsoft. Yet nothing had really been written about how Microsoft developed software.
In 1992 or so I suggested to an IBM person (Stan Smith), who was doing a master’s thesis under me at MIT, that he write his thesis comparing mainframe and PC software development. So he compared IBM and Fujitsu with Microsoft and Lotus, and got an interview at Microsoft, and I went with him there. When I heard the story of how Microsoft was developing software, I immediately knew this was very, very different from the waterfall world of software development that I had learned.
Almost all the principles of agile development— Microsoft was doing back then. They just didn’t call it that at the time.
So I immediately pitched a book to Microsoft, which eventually had to be approved by Bill Gates, which he did. I co-authored it with a professor of computer science, Richard Selby, because Stan went back to IBM. [Cusumano and Selby published the book, Microsoft Secrets, in 1995.]
TCS: So what did you learn about the ways that Microsoft developed software in the 1990s?
Cusumano: Since this interview is about lean and agile management approaches, I think you’ll find this interesting: Almost all the principles of agile development—Microsoft was doing back then. They just didn’t call it that at the time.
They did certain things differently. But the basic tenets of daily builds, continuous integration testing, working around small chunks of code, features, small feature teams—Microsoft developers were all doing those things. I must note that the company wasn’t doing this in all of their [product] groups. But they were doing it in their best groups—Excel and Word, among them. The Excel group pushed these techniques the furthest. Eventually all development groups in Microsoft adopted these practices, with some variations.
We never called it ‘lean,’ but they thought of themselves that way, especially when they compared themselves to IBM.
TCS: So now we circle back to agile development. When you look at your research over the last 30-plus years, starting with manufacturing and product development processes in the auto industry, and then moving to software development and software business strategy more recently, are there any principles in developing and making cars that transcend to software?
Cusumano: At a higher level of principles, there are a half-dozen points that I make. The most critical one is about waterfall’s sequential approach to development vs. doing things concurrently or in parallel. In both cases, when you do things sequentially it’s going to take a longer time.
So why was GM’s product development cycle 64 months back then? It was because of the way they scheduled things. They had certain bottlenecks and couldn’t do certain things in parallel because they had never tried to do them in parallel. When we looked at how the Japanese auto companies got product development down to 40-42 months, they were doing a whole bunch of things in parallel. For example, they were starting their manufacturing preparations and die manufacturing almost concurrently. They were sharing information with the different teams. As soon as they could figure out the dimensions of a car door, the die guys would start working. They didn’t wait until the whole car was designed. So they started overlapping a lot of those phases.
If you look at waterfall vs. agile/lean methods, or what Selby and I called the ‘synchronize-and-stabilize’ approach, which is the name we used in the book about Microsoft, the company was doing a lot of things in parallel. They would start writing code before they had a complete specification. Sometimes they never got a complete spec. They would start integration testing as early as possible; they didn’t wait to test a system until the end.
Another thing we found was that there could be a lot of wasted effort if you have to redo a lot of work. If you built a prototype of a software product and showed it to customers early, you could eliminate a lot of those changes later on. Even if you were doing a lot of what seemed to be re-work, or fixing bugs, early by throwing code into integration tests early, you were still saving yourself a lot of time in the end.
Firms that did early prototype-driven development—and not just throw-away prototypes—but working prototypes, and then did small incremental but frequent builds, and continuous design and coding reviews ended up with higher productivity and better software quality than software developed through waterfall-ish approaches.
TCS: So the last thing we come to is the topic of building software for Internet applications. You’ve written about this too, starting 20 years ago, comparing how one of the early Web browser companies (Netscape) and Microsoft competed against each other in the early days of the Web.
Cusumano: When Netscape came to market with one of the first Internet browsers (Navigator), they had basically copied some of Microsoft’s practices. They were doing daily builds, for example. But one of the things that was very different with Netscape is that they weren’t printing software on disks and putting disks in boxes and shipping boxes to stores and that kind of thing. They weren’t delivering software that way. They also weren’t necessarily delivering software to PC manufacturers. That’s the way that Microsoft delivered software; that slowed the cycle.
Netscape was just posting new versions of Navigator on its website and you downloaded it. So we saw at Netscape that they would have new releases every week, or every other week. That was a completely different way of developing and releasing software. In Microsoft, those would all be internal releases. In Netscape, they were public releases.
Microsoft came up with its own browser (Explorer), but the first couple of versions weren’t very good. But by version 3 they had caught up and Netscape got bogged down. Netscape had added all these features around the browser and they were not as disciplined as Microsoft. So eventually the daily builds wouldn’t work. They had around 30 million lines of spaghetti code; those are the phrases Netscape engineers used internally.
So Netscape did things too fast and they were not very disciplined at testing. We think Microsoft won the browser wars because they actually had a better browser by the time you got to version 3 or 4. And then, of course, Netscape sold itself to AOL, although the code lives on in Firefox.
TCS: And of course, since those early Web days of browser wars, we’re seeing whole industries being upended by the Internet: media, retailing, banking, the taxi, and hotel industries, and many more. What do you think that means for the way companies develop software, and whole Internet-based businesses that of course require software?
Cusumano: I must admit that I don’t know much about how these companies develop software these days. But I don’t see software development as a problem for them. Whereas 30 years ago software development was a huge problem, the bigger problem now seems to be their strategy or business model.
Perhaps software development is much less of a problem today because people have more knowledge of what good practices are, and that they’ve largely abandoned, although not completely, the old waterfall style. They have become much more careful about how and when they use the waterfall and are more eclectic in methods.
In addition, a lot of big companies today have outsourced their software development. That’s another reason why it’s not a problem. These companies may have some lean in-house staffs, but outside specialists are building a lot of their software, although that might be different for defense companies or large banks, or small Internet startups.
In general, once companies stopped trying to force square pegs into round holes, or force a methodology that might work for space shuttle software but is not necessary for a smartphone app, then software development got a lot easier for a lot of companies.

53,"Steve Blank has been at the epicenter of the ‘lean startup’ movement since he ignited it in 2006 with his book The Four Steps to the Epiphany. A Silicon Valley entrepreneur for 21 years who founded or was involved in the launch of eight technology startups (both successes and failures), Blank left that world in 1999 to teach and consult on startups.
Today, Blank’s Lean LaunchPad approach (which he teaches at Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley, and Columbia University) is taught at more than 75 universities worldwide. What’s more, lean startup methods have been embraced by a number of government and scientific organizations. Blank’s Stanford class became the curriculum for the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps in 2011; since that time, over a thousand scientists and engineers have taken the course to help commercialize their ideas. Blank also co-created the Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy programs, which use lean startup methods to address critical national security problems. You can read his extensive writings at https://www.steveblank.com/.
At the turn of the century, one of Blank’s students was Eric Ries, who launched two companies that Blank had funded. The first practitioner of Blank’s lean startup method, Ries took the concept mainstream after publishing two books, The Lean Startup and The Startup Way.
From his Silicon Valley outpost, Blank has continued to publish books about lean startup methods as well, including the bestselling Startup Owner’s Manual 1 (co-authored with Bob Dorf ). In addition, Blank has been an author or co-author of eight Harvard Business Review articles, including a May 2013 cover article (‘Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything’2) and an article in HBR’s November–December 2017 print edition (‘When Founders Go Too Far’3).
He recently talked about his lean startup principles, the reasons why big, established companies, and government agencies need to adopt them, and the challenges they’ve had in trying to do so.
TCS: Your ideas around the lean startup have jumped the tracks from the startup world to the big-company world and to the government. But before you talk about how large organizations are using them, take us back to the evolution of the ideas.
Steve Blank: It started just from a very personal basis. I was a serial entrepreneur. I did eight startups in 21 years and retired in ‘99. When you’re a practitioner, you don’t have time to think about big picture stuff; you just do what you are told. If you’re lucky and good, you get to do it again.
When I retired, I started thinking about the innovation of entrepreneurship. It struck me that in the 20th century, startup investors treated startups like they were nothing more than smaller versions of large companies. It was a big idea.
What [startup investors] essentially said was, “If big companies are doing [business] plans, we want a plan. Big companies do five-year forecasts, so obviously before we invest we need to see the forecast.” And “Big companies hire sales, marketing, and [business development] people on Day 1, that’s what we want you, the startup, to do.” And “Big companies build their products with waterfall engineering, which is a serial process that specifies all the features and then works for the next year or two to delivering them for Release 1.0.”
Startups are not smaller versions of large companies. Large companies are large because they execute a known business model.
But it wasn’t until I retired and started thinking about this that I realized it was wrong—big time! Startups are not smaller versions of large companies. Large companies are large because they execute a known business model. A known business model is 95% of what large companies do. It’s “Gee, we know our channel, we know our customers, we know our pricing, we know our competitors, we know lots of stuff.” And most of this stuff is continuing to fill the pipeline with product line extensions and new features, painting it blue or whatever. That is a known business model.
By contrast, startups have very few things that are known. Startups are searching for a business model.
Yet business schools have built 100 years of tools and techniques for executing known business models of existing companies. Remember, business schools were designed to graduate people with degrees in business administration. Therefore, we were building tools to help those administrators. But no one had consciously said that perhaps we need a management toolset in a management stack for innovators. It didn’t exist. The language barely existed.
So I started reading all the literature about innovation. The irony here was that very little literature existed about startups. There was literature about corporate innovation—Rita McGrath stuff, Clayton Christensen stuff, and so on. But I felt it was about innovation in the context of environment that was primarily focused on execution.
To make a long story short, I wrote The Four Steps to the Epiphany. That was the first time anyone ever described the difference between search (startups) and execution (existing companies). That kicked off the lean startup movement by describing one of the three components of lean: the customer development process. I said a startup has no facts about real customers when the people in that startup stay inside their building. Therefore, they need to get the heck outside.
Then one of my students, Eric Ries, said, “Steve, you grew up in the 20th century with waterfall engineering, where products were built serially, but startups are now using something called agile engineering, where they’re building the products iteratively and incrementally. That is a perfect fit for customer development. So why don’t we combine customer development and agile engineering.”
Then I ran into someone named Alexander Osterwalder, who had figured out how to map a 40-page business plans into a single diagram called the business model canvas. So I adopted Osterwalder’s canvas as a living scorecard for first articulating the hypotheses a startup needs to test, and then to keep track of what they learned—using my customer development process, as well as to test the minimal viable products we were building using Eric’s agile engineering method.
Those three components—business model design, customer development, and agile engineering—became the lean startup.
One key idea of this lean method was this notion that we’re learning new things as we talk to customers and test minimum viable products. And as we learn, we give startups permission to make substantive changes to their business model. These changes are called a pivot. It’s hard to remember, but in the old days—and this still happens in corporations—once your plan is blessed, any deviation is considered a failure instead of as learning.
Geez! What were we thinking?
TCS: So the venture capitalists in Silicon Valley in the 1980s and ‘90s got nervous if the founders changed their initial business model.
Blank: Yeah, and [when that happened] they fired the founders. Any failure was treated as a failure of the individuals, not a failure of the initial hypothesis or assumptions. That’s a huge idea. Huge. Their belief was, “There can be nothing wrong with the plan. I funded it! It must be an execution problem.”
By the way, it wasn’t that the founders were always right. But there was no notion that they needed to be testing and exploring their [company’s] hypotheses—about customers, about features wanted, about pricing, channel, etc. … The other problem was that we started staffing and building a burn rate per the business plan. I remember being in companies where the only thing that [went according to] plan was our burn rate! You kind of go, “I don’t think this is right,” even though you got three-quarters of the plan correct.
So I said, “What’s wrong with this movie?”
TCS: When you stopped launching companies in 1999, venture capital was abundant. So perhaps the VCs were not too worried about many of their portfolio companies failing, as long as they had a few winners that more than made up for the losers.
Blank: During the last dot-com boom (around 1999), we didn’t need any of this [lean startup] stuff because we had infinite cash. Post dot-com crash, people were being pretty judicious about time and resources, and lean made all the sense in the world. The irony is that now with funds like Sequoia and even more so like Softbank, [having huge funds] makes up for everything. Their approach is “It doesn’t matter, I’ll buy my way in.”
The irony is that the need for lean has now moved from startups, which had to be judicious with cash, to [established] corporations, which are actually much more threatened than startups.
The real surprise for me is that some startups now have more capital than large corporations.
Herein lies the opportunity of using lean startup approaches in corporations. Big companies that survive are no longer just delivering what McKinsey called Horizon One innovation (incremental features, colors, supply chain efficiencies, and so on), and Horizon Two innovation (satisfying the needs of existing customers with new products). The ones that are going to stay in business are now acting like startups by delivering what McKinsey 30 years ago called the third horizon of innovation—i.e., disruption. Apple, the computer company, getting into music. Amazon, the ecommerce company, buying Whole Foods.
Large corporations have great managers dealing with Horizon One and Two types of innovation. The problem is they are facing continuous disruption; they have Horizon Three problems now, but the wrong leadership to deal with them. If you got your MBA more than three years ago, everything you know about innovation is obsolete.
For the first time in the history of corporations, [established] companies are not setting the rules. The rules are changing rapidly. That’s why you see all this M&A activity and people just trying to figure out what the new rules are. There is probably more innovation and creative disruption right now of corporations since maybe in the gilded age in the U.S. [the late 1800s].
TCS: So largely speaking, how have large companies reacted to the lean startup ideas since you started publishing them?
Blank: Between my work and Eric Ries’ work [who in his book wrote about their application at GE and Procter & Gamble], there has been recognition and adoption at various levels. But it’s hard to turn super tankers. Remember, large corporations can innovate not only by using lean methodologies to build internal innovation; they can also buy companies.
TCS: What are the biggest challenges large companies face in adopting lean startup approaches?
Blank: It’s the other way around. The issue is not about adoption of lean. The issue is about dealing with continuous disruption. Lean is just a tool in a tool set. It is not the answer. It is a component of this: “How do I change the engines of the plane while it’s in flight? Am I reconfiguring the product line? Am I going digital? Am I changing channels? Am I reinventing the company? And am I willing to bet my job, and is my strategy aligned with my investors and my board?”
TCS: So what five years after Harvard Business Review published your article on the lean startup, are big companies doing enough to make their ventures lean?
Blank: I keep telling [HBR] they ought to be writing the article, “Why the Lean Startup Changed Nothing.” [He laughs] [The article] mostly resulted in innovation theater: a set of activities, typically like incubators and accelerators inside a company, that generate great coffee cups, posters, and lanyards, and almost nothing else. My test [for their effectiveness] is this:
Did it move the top or bottom line? What I often get back is, “Let me show you our ‘Dogs at Work Policy.’”
What I’ve learned is that companies don’t just need to build a lean startup process. They need to build an end-to-end innovation pipeline that has a funnel on the left and deliverables on the right. If you don’t know the ratio of funnel ideas to deliverables, you’re going to get it wrong. The big mistake is confusing activities with deliverables. When I ask them about deliverables, the answer for some 90% of them or more is they have none yet.
You’re not going to believe this, but it turns out the people who are doing it right is the U.S. government.
The approach plays out slightly differently for government agencies. But because the government is being disrupted, the consequences are even greater than they are for companies. Macy’s can go out of business in the U.S. and the country will still go on. We can’t afford to have part of our Defense Department go out of business from being disrupted.
They get it. They understand it. Their disruption is pretty clear. In the 20th century, the country was essentially facing a single adversary. Now you need a scorecard. They need to scale [their innovations] to today’s [much higher] number of adversaries. They now realize the answer is not only tech, which is machine learning and robotics and whatever, but also innovation processes that are radically different than the way they’ve been building requirements and acquiring products and services.
The Defense Department has adopted not just lean but this notion of an innovation pipeline incredibly fast. The 2018 National Security Strategy, written by the Secretary of Defense, is probably one of the most important innovation documents so far of the 21st century. It said, “Organize for innovation. The Department’s management structure and processes are not written in stone, they are a means to an end–empowering the warfighter with the knowledge, equipment and support systems to fight and win. Department leaders will adapt their organizational structures to best support the Joint Force. If current structures hinder substantial increases in lethality or performance, it is expected that Service Secretaries and Agency heads will consolidate, eliminate, or restructure as needed. The Department’s leadership is committed to changes in authorities, granting of waivers, and securing external support for streamlining processes and organizations.”
It feels a lot like the lean startup take-up that we had in Silicon Valley. It’s catching on in the U.S. government, and it’s saving lives.

54,"For 30 years, Tom Davenport has been one of the most influential advisors globally on the business impact and application of information technology. He made the topic of big data and analytics a boardroom issue with his groundbreaking 2006 Harvard Business Review article (“Competing on Analytics”1) and a 2007 book2 of the same name. In 2016, Davenport and Julia Kirby published a book on AI (Only Humans Need Apply: Winners and Losers in the Age of Smart Machines3). Since the late 1980s, he has conducted research and published dozens of Harvard Business Review articles and 18 books, many of which have been bestsellers. Davenport is a professor at Babson College near Boston, a Fellow of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, a co-founder of the International Institute for Analytics, and a senior advisor to Deloitte’s analytics practice.
TCS: You, more than anyone else, made executives aware of the opportunities of big data and analytics more than 10 years ago with your Harvard Business Review article and the book that followed. Now the market’s attention seems to have shifted away from analytics to artificial intelligence. Since both depend on digital data, there must be a big connection between the two—one that may be getting lost in the marketplace. How would you describe that connection?
Davenport: The fact that we have so much digital data today—in some domains, a massive amount— means AI can succeed now in areas in which it was struggling. One example is image and facial recognition. Yes, I realize that recognizing cat photos on the internet is not one of humankind’s greatest advances (laughs).
But, seriously, the distinction between big data and analytics and AI is a little bit artificial because so much of AI is based on big data and analytics. It makes big data and analytics a more autonomous and, in some cases, a more sophisticated and complex form of analytics. Some forms of AI are more semantics-based in their orientation, in trying to understand human language and so on. But the largest activity in AI, and the most sophisticated, is machine learning. Its new forms, like deep learning, are among the biggest changes in the current round of AI, and it is statistical in nature.
“The largest activity in AI, and the most sophisticated, is machine learning.”
You need a lot of data and statistical algorithms to analyze this data, no matter which of the four areas of analytics I’ve written about (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive, and automated). But with AI, you get industrial-scale analytics by automating the analysis.
TCS: So does that mean you’d advise companies that haven’t mastered big data and analytics not to go right to mastering AI?
Davenport: That’s right. Any company that would skip analytics and go straight to AI is not likely to be successful with AI. I was talking recently with an Asian insurance company, which is interested in automating some aspects of their underwriting. But the problem is, the business unit that proposed this doesn’t use analytics to any great extent for underwriting. They continue to rely on the judgment and experience of their people who make decisions on business insurance. I think it will be very difficult to make that jump without having done the analytics and accumulating the data you need for the analytics.
“Any company that would skip analytics and go straight to AI is not likely to be successful with AI.”
TCS: In your book last year you talked about automation vs. augmentation. Talk to us briefly about each type of usage and are most companies automation over augmentation and if so, why?
Davenport: Automation, of course, is the replacement of human workers by machines. Augmentation is when machines and people work together alongside each other. Perhaps because I am a human I am partial to augmentation. My book with Julia Kirby lays out five approaches to augmentation—three that involve humans working closely with smart machines, and two that involve humans prospering by avoiding machines. My research since the book suggests that a great majority of companies that are implementing AI are pursuing augmentation. There has been very little job loss thus far. I am sure there will be some jobs lost to AI in the future, but I think they will be in lower numbers—and it will take longer for the jobs to go away—than most other observers.
TCS: Do you believe every industry has big opportunities from cognitive technologies? And which ones do you believe have some of the biggest opportunities?
Davenport: The opportunities are there for every industry. But for sure, some will move slower than others. It will be the same ones that moved more slowly with analytics. The availability of data is the key gating factor. B2B companies, for example, just don’t tend to have as much data as B2C companies, at least not customer data.
In the example I mentioned earlier, business insurance will move more slowly with AI than personal lines. Any industry where you don’t have much data is going to be challenged by doing really sophisticated work in this area. Also, smaller businesses are moving much more slowly than big businesses with AI, as they have with other technologies.
The nature of what a company sells also will determine whether it moves quickly or slowly. Those offering a purely digital product are going to explore AI much faster. Banking is basically all digital now, and rapid adoption of robo-advice is evidence of that. AI has also been pretty pervasive in asset management and trading for a while and getting more so.
In medicine, digital specialties like radiology and pathology are likely to be the first to embrace AI. Medical activities that involve a lot of face-to-face contact with patients or physical manipulation of patients will probably proceed more slowly.
The media industry—and especially online media such as Facebook and Google that were born digital—have huge opportunities with AI. Google and Facebook are among the world leaders in using AI, and yet they are still finding their way about just how automated they can be. Facebook has had some false starts in terms of not being able to easily identify fake news vs. real news, and so it had to back away a little bit. It also wasn’t able to fully use automated approaches to identify offensive images, so it has a large number of people still doing that.
But they’re trying AI all over the place. For the most part, they have been quite successful at automating key aspects of figuring out what ads to run on what sites. That’s been very lucrative for both Google and Facebook.
TCS: What jobs do you believe are at greatest risk in companies because of AI?
Davenport: The way I think about it is this: If you’re doing something that is the same as what everyone else does, you will have two problems. The first is someone can probably identify the structure of your job, and if they can identify the structure they can probably write some code to automate it. The second problem is that if you have a job that many other people are doing, there is a lot of economic incentive to go to the trouble of automating it.
If you have a niche job that few people do, why would anybody bother automating it? My favorite example of this comes from a newspaper story I read a couple of years ago. It talked about a person who connects buyers and sellers of Dunkin Donuts franchises (a U.S. restaurant chain). He makes an incredible living and drives around in a Rolls Royce. And connecting buyers and sellers is something that machines do all the time. But I think that is such a niche that nobody would view it as economical to automate.
TCS: Should companies that invest, or plan to invest, heavily in AI be transparent with employees about what they are doing and why they are doing it? Should they address their worry about jobs?
Davenport: In first place, cutting jobs through automation is generally not a good strategy. It’s a race to the bottom in that your costs will go down, but you should expect competitors will do the same thing. That means everybody’s margins in your industry will drop, and it will be harder to innovate. Unless you already make a highly commoditized product, it will be a race to the bottom.
“We have to increase our productivity, which in the U.S. has been growing very slowly or even falling in 2016.”
What’s more, in the transition from humans doing the work to computers doing the work, you need a lot of help from the people doing the work. You’re far more likely to get that help if you give them some assurances that they will be able to keep their jobs.
I think we have to get some economic benefit from all of this technology. We have to increase our productivity, which in the U.S. has been growing very slowly or even falling in 2016. To boost productivity, companies produce more with less cost. But the best way to achieve that is through attrition, not through layoffs. Implementing AI is going to be a slow process anyway, so you might as well get some loyalty from your employees and say you’re only going to reduce jobs through attrition.
TCS: Do you come across companies that are thinking carefully about how these smart machines will affect employee jobs, and how employees might begin to prepare for the transition?
Davenport: It’s very early days for that. But General Electric has started to do it. They’ve created these personas of the types of jobs that are likely to be threatened, new types of jobs that will be created, and the jobs that will be largely augmented by machines. That was one of the topics they addressed at a big strategy meeting recently in Boston.
“The key for thought leaders will be in coming up with new ideas rather than describing numbers about old ideas.”
But I would still say it’s pretty early for that kind of conversation. It should be happening more frequently, but it’s not. It should be happening more for several reasons. In addition to not creating a workforce where fear of automation takes over, the fact is it will take a while to train people on the new skills they’ll need to work effectively alongside the machines. This is the “augmentation” model for AI. Now these people may hold back their knowledge and their support if they are worried that they are going to lose their jobs. So for a variety of reasons it makes sense to be upfront and start that early.
TCS: Do you think thought leaders soon will be facing competition from AI?
Davenport: Well, not the good ones (laughs). But I do think certain aspects of what professional services firms have referred to as thought leadership could well be at least partially automated. For example, many of them do surveys; you could easily imagine systems that automatically generated text about the results of those surveys, just like you have systems that automatically generate write-ups of baseball games and company earnings reports. Now, I don’t think there is any application available for this yet for surveys.
But if and when there are, I think they might be able to do a better job at writing about the numbers than a human could. For example, an AI writing application could make comparisons to other surveys, and provide analysis that a human might not notice because he or she might get bored poring over survey numbers.
This kind of writing application has worked quite well at the Associated Press and other organizations that have been automating the writing of numbers-driven reports. In fact, several companies have automated the writing of monthly investment reports, and Suspicious Activity Reports for money laundering in banking. Writing about numbers is increasingly going to be automated.
The key for thought leaders will be in coming up with new ideas rather than describing numbers about old ideas.

55,"Every company today must digitally transform itself to be ready
    for Industry 4.0: a business world in which orders come to a
    company through customers’ smartphones, and products are
    delivered in digital form to their digital devices. (Think banking,
    media, software, travel booking, and more.) And even if the
    products aren’t fully digital, the service that’s delivered is likely
    to be transacted and consumed with a lot of digital help. (Think
    Amazon’s cashier-less grocery stores, or the visitors to Walt Disney
    World in Florida wearing “Magic Band” digital bracelets.)
However, to transform themselves for a digital world and give customers a personalized digital experience, companies must recognize the importance of digital data. Unfortunately, digital data is the overlooked element of digital transformation, akin to electricity in an industrial economy, or oil in the automotive sector.
Without data that can be digitized, processed in volume, dissected to produce new insights about the business, and acted upon quickly, a company cannot digitally transform itself. It needs such data and the ability to use it to constantly monitor its performance for customers, the state of its operations, and its financial condition for the board. Without superior capabilities in managing digital data, that company can’t be responsive enough to customers. It won’t be able to personalize and deliver promotions at the right shopping moment to a shopper’s smartphone. It won’t have an up-to-the-minute picture of the state of its supply chain and customer performance. And it won’t be able to build superb financial systems that can identify revenue leakage, fraud and other problems that can turn into audit (and thus boardroom) and regulatory issues rapidly.

To put it simply, digital data is the DNA that guides digital transformation. It is why such data has become a board-level matter. Companies that can gather, process, analyze and use the digital data that’s coursing through their digital systems are gaining three huge advantages in the marketplace:

They can generate new revenue faster, recognizing new customer opportunities and evolving new business models with greater agility. 
 They are more profitable because they have automated previously manual data processes through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) (lowering costs and improving revenue recognition while speeding the close).
They can process more digital data thereby driving more data-based business strategies and enabling them to take calculated growth risks. 


However, many companies struggle to maximize the value of the increasingly large volumes of digital data they collect. This is understandable. One reason is that the amount of digital data that companies now collect is huge and growing. An astonishing 90% of the world’s digital data was created in just the last two years—nearly seven decades after the first computers began showing up in offices.1  And the volume of digital data is only going to grow exponentially due to smartphones (born in 2007 and now becoming ubiquitous), the Internet of Things (billions of sensors attached to everything from coffee parts to aircraft engines), and ever more digital devices.
The inability to manage this explosion of digital data is why cloud computing revenue is growing rapidly at such companies as Amazon, Microsoft and Google. In our view, it shows that most large companies understand they can’t afford the enormous amounts of processing power required to process and secure all that data in their own data centers. Those cloud companies were part of a $41 billion public cloud market last year, according to Gartner.2  These essentially are data utilities: huge computing factories that collect, secure, process, and provide tools to analyze and transmit digital data to organizations that need it.
The digital transformation of business— necessary now for competitive advantage and survival—demands exceptional data management capabilities. However, right now, these capabilities are not widespread in the marketplace.
Lagging Digital Data Practices
Most big companies recognize that they’re only fair (or worse) at managing their digital data. In a 2018 Gartner survey of nearly 200 organizations around the world, 60% rated themselves average or below average in using and analyzing their digital data.3  Only 9% would categorize their data maturity at the highest level: (‘transformational’), where data is available to all departments and business units (not sequestered inside them), and analytics practices and tools and insights are shared liberally around a company, enabling the organization to grow while improving internal processes, especially financial ones.
Digital data deficiencies can be seen in four areas:
1. Data collection. Digitally immature organizations lack a coherent data inventory, or ‘data blueprint,’ meaning they aren’t fully cognizant of what data they possess. Although organizations capture huge volumes of digital data in multiple channels about virtually every business process, their products, and customer interactions, many companies have no comprehensive catalog of the data or its state. Every organization has a hierarchy of business processes that rely on data, but many lack an overview of how the datasets they have relate to each of these processes. What’s more, they often don’t know how the data relates to how well the company’s marketing, sales, R&D, distribution and other key business processes are performing. For example, they don’t know what data is most important to identifying a new customer, or convincing that customer to buy. When they look at where they are collecting data, these companies often discover they don’t have nearly the data they need for a superior customer service experience or for demand generation. They typically find they have data siloes (departments that don’t share critical data, especially about customers), missing internal data (information they never thought of collecting before, often because of the cost or impossibility of collecting it (often images and voice), and missing external data—especially from business partners such as suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers.
2. Processing data. When the big data trend erupted, companies sought to take advantage. They collected data from diverse sources internally and externally. It came from partners, public sources, social media, and sensors in connected devices. They availed themselves of falling storage costs, new database technologies and ever-expanding and accessible computing resources and power, including the cloud. But many underestimated how much data they’d have to process. The result is that the computational tasks in numerous large companies require enormous computing power and data center management skills that even the largest IT shops don’t have. That’s why there’s a huge public cloud computing business that is growing rapidly, and some companies are investigating the potential of high-performance and quantum computing.
3. Analyzing data. Even if a company can collect and process all the digital data it must, if it can’t analyze it—ferreting out the trends and other insights that result in more sales, higher profits, more efficient manufacturing and distribution, and so on—the business will suffer. And although many companies have pockets of excellence in analyzing their data, and often have achieved some benefits, those impacts frequently are limited to those functions that invested in analytics skills and technologies. These groups developed ways of structuring and analyzing data that were tailored to their teams’ specific uses, such as marketing, but they have limited applicability to other functions. Extending the benefits of data widely across organizations is critical to improving every business operation and identifying growth opportunities. It’s key to becoming more agile and accelerating decision-making.
4. Making rapid decisions and changes after generating insights on digital data. Recent technology advances, such as AI and cloud computing, present new opportunities to increase ROI, improve business processes, and delight customers. AI enables fast decision-making. Cloud computing provides for the efficient use of computing resources and it facilitates the ability to disseminate data-based insights, whether customer-focused or internal, across an organization. Companies that don’t take advantage of on-demand scalability to manage data within and outside the enterprise and use plug-and-play facilities for intelligent applications, services, solutions, and tools soon will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, if they are not already.
Let’s now look at how best-practice companies manage their digital data.
Three Steps to Leveraging Data
From our work with dozens of large companies around the world in improving their digital data
    management capabilities, we have found three steps to becoming proficient at leveraging such data:
Assess the current state by benchmarking the company’s digital intelligence: its capabilities in gathering, processing, analyzing, and acting on data. It should also cover which technologies are currently in use, including whether cloud-based systems are deployed.
    People and processes should also be evaluated to determine which skills and positions in the organization are enabling the use of analytics, the processes being used to manage them, and where there may be gaps. 
A candid assessment will identify the extent to which leaders embrace the importance of using data to identify strategic opportunities and insights about the business, its competitors and customers. Leaders who aren’t aware of the potential benefits of leveraging digital data can learn. Examples of successful analytics use within the company, information about competitors’ activities, or evidence of what stronger capabilities could mean for the business can help make the case.
Determine where the company should go and map out how to build the capabilities required to get there. The plan should include the technologies that will be used to inform decisions and execute processes. It should factor in the opportunities afforded by cloud computing, including how the company will share data analytics resources internally. Here, the task is to determine a “target state,=.” Key goals for this step include identifying how data will help innovation and ways to introduce automation in the company’s data management and decision-making. Questions to be answered include: Which sources currently are in use? What will be needed in the optimal state? Internally, sources can include customer records from activities in physical and digital channels such as smartphones and websites. Externally, data may be retrieved from partners about their activities with shared customers, and from social media, including consumer sentiment data. New data may come from sources such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Other sources, such as public data from government databases, may also be valuable.
Point the company’s analytics instruments at the strongest opportunities for increasing revenue, improving profitability, and mitigating risk. Establishing consistent models for collecting, formatting, storing, and analyzing data will enable a company to reuse its data in different parts of the organization. Customer data can be useful across marketing, sales, finance, and supply chain management. Using the tools of data analysis is also crucial. A combination of technologies enables companies to process and analyze more data more effectively. This leads to better decisions. Finally, the company must acquire analytics skills, as well as the skills to create a data-driven culture fueled by analytics. That involves creating an immersive analytics environment in which the data trends are brought to life through information visualization, visual analytics, virtual and augmented reality, and intuitive user interfaces. 
The key to digital data usage is establishing the means for business experts to collaborate with the data and analytics experts. As with every major change in business culture, the transformation requires leadership from the very top of an organization—i.e., the board of directors.
What Organizations Get When They Master Their Data
The practices we’ve described have top- and bottom-line outcomes. Managing the collection, processing, analysis, and usage of digital data in superior ways leads to superior operational and financial performance of three types: increased revenue, greater profitability, and lower risk. Let’s look at each one.
More Revenue
Superior management of digital data is proving time and again to boost companies’ top line. Examples are numerous. 
To increase revenue and improve profitability, Monsanto, the $14 billion agricultural and biotech company, launched a cloud analytics platform it calls “science@scale”. The platform enables the company’s data experts and scientists to collaborate, accelerating the development of analytics-driven decision models, according to Monsanto CIO James Swanson.4   The company estimates it gained $17 million in top-line U.S. revenue and saved $15 million in operating costs because the platform enables scientific work to be completed in hours rather than months.
ABB, a $34 billion industrial firm that services power plants and automates industrial processes, credits its ABB Ability platform of services 5 with driving an 11% increase in orders for its software and services in 2017. 6 The platform collects real-time data, analyzes, and monitors conditions at factories, oil wells, and power plants to reduce operating costs, and improve safety and maintenance. The company estimates the platform has the potential to generate $20 billion in annual sales.7 
Using analytics, AI, and other intelligent technologies, such companies can now gain insights about the health of their business processes and the performance of products in the field. They can use these insights to evaluate and pursue opportunities to monetize data by selling it to organizations that would benefit from it. Above all, the meaning they derive from data can lead to growth, improved profitability, and stronger risk management capabilities.
Insights from digital data can shed light on customer wants and needs permitting a company to offer improved customer experiences and increase sales. These insights lead to the identification of opportunities for growth and more profitable business models, as ABB’s experience illustrates.
“Speed-to-insight,” enabled by cloud-based analytics services, is crucial for organizations to reap the benefits of digital data at volume. Monsanto’s science@scale platform has created savings and generated revenues by accelerating data analysis. 
Higher Profitability
Digital data gives firms new avenues for operational improvements—both back office and customer-facing— and better-informed investments that can improve profitability. For example, a firm can use IoT sensors in its facilities to capture data on its energy usage, then analyze temperatures, occupancy levels, and other conditions to optimize energy consumption and reduce operating costs, growing operating margins.
Siemens, the $88 billion global energy, engineering and manufacturing giant, recently launched a new business using intelligent sensors and software to analyze U.S. railroad data. The insights it derived helped railroad operators anticipate errors and boost performance. (A train that isn’t operating isn’t generating either revenue or profit, but it’s still consuming resources.) The system, an “Internet of Trains,”8  is being deployed by railroads in multiple countries. 9
By using data from ecosystems partners, a company can create valuable insights that it can use or sell to others. Monsanto’s Climate Corporation unit has established a hub for agricultural technology firms to sell apps to farmers. They use them to access multiple data streams and track their operations from a variety of viewpoints. With insights from soil moisture sensors, weather data, and satellite imagery, they can improve the way they manage their farms.10 Saving money by reducing wasteful practices is crucial to farmers.
John Deere, the $29 billion maker of farm and construction machinery, partners with Cornell University on analytical tools for farmers. The platform they developed, Ag-Analytics, integrates public data sources with data from John Deere equipment to give farmers insights about field conditions and more, including less expensive conservation practices.11 
Reduced Risk
Digital data, managed well, can also help companies reduce the risks they take every day in their business—in giving credit to poor credit risks, in being in compliance with regulatory authorities, and much more.
Consider HSBC, the $31 billion banking giant. The bank is using AI to automate its compliance processes, including anti money-laundering investigations that traditionally involve thousands of employees. A pilot project working with AI startup Ayasdi saw the number of expensive investigations drop 20%. “We reduce risks. And it costs less money,” HSBC Holdings COO Andy Maguire says.12
Progressive Insurance, the $23 billion automobile insurer, launched a telematics app in 2015 13 to collect information on customers’ driving. Over the next two years, the company collected 14 billion miles’ worth of driver data, and analyzed it using a machine-learning platform. Progressive was better able to distinguish between safe drivers and riskier ones and reward the safe drivers with an average $130 discount. 14
Intelligent systems that enable machines and people to collaborate more effectively lead to more responsive, better decisions. Traditionally, risk managers have based their analyses by examining small data sets to find exceptions to the norm. Such compliance checks have been routine and successfully uncover risks that need mitigation. But risks can sometimes take a long time to surface in small samples. Today’s data storage, management, and analysis technologies make it possible to examine much larger data sets, such as all transactions a bank has processed within a period. Larger samples produce more reliable results, and the more data AI and analytics can work with the more accurate and intelligent they become. This means risks to a company’s reputation, finances, or compliance practices can be detected more quickly and accurately. 
The Data Revolution
As these examples show, using digital data effectively can enable a business to make more informed and timely decisions. Automating analytics enables companies to create business processes that require no human intervention, allowing leaders to focus on new opportunities and higher quality decision-making. That is the essence of business agility in the digital age.
Once an organization acquires a comprehensive view of its data landscape and its current capabilities, it can implement programs to achieve the benefits of today’s new and powerful technologies. This journey to more mature data handling and analytics maturity can be broken down into a series of recommended steps.
With a clear roadmap to data and analytics maturity that accounts for advances in data sources, data management, technology, and analytics skills, organizations can prepare to reap the value of their investment and their digital data. But data by itself means little. Companies must make all their data meaningful. That means they must master analytics techniques—approaches to making sense of data—not just data collection and processing alone.
A Way Around Roadblocks
In their efforts to reach data maturity, organizations may encounter many barriers. They may have difficulty realizing consistent benefits and find it hard to align data policies with evolving regulations.
Clarity about data and analytics maturity will emerge from a frank assessment of the organization, as well as what it will take to achieve its target state and realize meaningful benefits from its data. In preparing a roadmap to reach the target state, a company will assess its skills—most importantly the business expertise it requires—and identify the additional skills and talent it will need. It will also identify the digital data streams and formats required for expanding the use of analytics. The technologies (including cloud-based systems) it needs to achieve company goals will become clear.
To ensure a company has strong capabilities in data and analytics across the enterprise, and not simply in isolated pockets, an organization must adopt a vision of analytics for all, combining best practices and frameworks to achieve digital and analytics maturity. It must not limit the use of appropriate tools to select functions or a few experts. The best way to achieve enterprise-wide distribution of analytic insight derived from digital data is to adopt cloud-based systems. These are designed expressly for universal accessibility.
Companies need to pursue opportunities for using their digital data while anticipating regulatory changes. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect in May 2018 prescribes heavy fines for violations.15  It applies to all organizations doing business and processing personal data in the EU, regardless of where they are headquartered. 
To ensure ongoing compliance, companies need to incorporate the conditions of GDPR as they build their analytics capabilities. And they should continue to monitor regulatory environments in all areas of the globe in which the company conducts business. 
Joining the Data-First Revolution
In recent years, the siren call of big data launched thousands of analytics efforts across all industries and sectors. Digital-native companies, with data-first mindsets, emerged. They took advantage of the explosion of data and the new technologies available to make it meaningful and actionable.
Now it’s time for established firms to step up. They must assess how good they are at managing their digital data and, with eyes wide open, assess their strengths and identify areas where they need to improve. Companies that are superior at collecting, processing, analyzing, and acting on data are out-marketing, out-selling, out-producing, out-servicing, and outperforming their competitors.
You could say, without exaggeration, that they are outsmarting the competition.

Many companies believe they can compete in the Business 4.0TM
 world merely by digitizing their existing products and services, and the key business processes that create demand and supply for them. That would be a mistake. Instead, leaders should take a step back and consider how they can reshape their entire business
 around digital technology - thus reinventing their business using what we refer to as a machine first approach to digital transformation.
By ""machine first"" we do not mean replacing every possible human worker with artificial intelligence and other technologies that automate labor. Instead, the machine first approach asks leaders to determine how to use three key digital
 technologies-cloud computing, artificial intelligence and analytics-in every aspect of their business: in the products and services they offer, how they develop their offerings, how they create supply and demand, how they support their customers, and more.
 By combining an agile approach to developing and continually improving these products and processes, companies can become digital powerhouses with new data-fueled business offerings that delight customers.
It is how a growing number of companies have become leaders in their sectors-digital natives such as Amazon in ecommerce and cloud services, Netflix in streaming movies, Uber in taxi service, and Peloton in fitness equipment. But
 it's also the way that companies founded before the rise of the Web are now overtaking competitors: CVS in pharmacies and health clinics; ABN AMRO in European financial services; Cummins in the truck engine market; and many others in industries that have rapidly
 been digitizing.
To take a machine first approach to revamping their business, executives must look for ways to eliminate unnecessary manual work of both the production and knowledge types. But leaders also must then free up employees to take on new
 roles and learn new skills. At the same time, they must reimagine and reposition their IT function, making its focus
business-first, and its core capabilities, ones we describe as ubiquitous, polymorphic, and secure.
In this article, we explain in more detail why companies should take a machine first approach to digital transformation, how to do it, and the capabilities they will need (especially their IT function) to make it real.
Reshaping the Business
In the Business 4.0 world, many products and services are becoming a purely digital phenomena, accessed
 through a digital device. Think streaming movies to your smartphone or laptop computer, or finding homes to buy and obtaining a mortgage through your tablet computer, or making a stock trade, or purchasing a ticket to a play or concert. They're increasingly
 becoming digital offerings secured through digital means.
In this transformation, technologies such as automation, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices enable companies to make unprecedented (and swift) changes to their business models. They also allow companies to make
 major improvements in key business processes-marketing and selling, product development, production and distribution, order fulfillment, talent management, and more.
As companies increasingly compete in a Business 4.0 world, they need to take a machine first approach to rethinking and redefining every aspect of their organization. This would include reexamining the
 following:

Business models - What they sell, to whom they sell it, and how they generate revenue from the transaction. For example, $20 billion engine manufacturer Cummins found a new revenue stream by digitally tracking the post-sale performance of its engines
 and providing remote monitoring that alerts trucking customers when their vehicles need preventative maintenance. Launched in 2014 as Connected Diagnostics, the service tracks more than 120,000 Cummins engines today in North America-more than 20 times the
 number just three years ago.1,2 
Core products and services - These increasingly will shift from analog alone to digital, or a combination of the two. For example, privately held stationary bike manufacturer Peloton has reached $700 million in annual revenue and a $4 billion valuation
 not only by selling its $1,995 bikes for home use but also by offering a subscription (for $20 a month) to live-streamed exercise classes. These subscriptions have played a part in helping Peloton achieve more than 100% annual revenue growth since its launch
 in 2012.3 For this stationary bike manufacturer, the product is no longer just the bike, but also the fitness exercises that come with it.

Marketing and sales - Advances in analytics enable companies to mine big data and unearth insights about the products and services that customers need and want, and how they use and react to them. Companies can use these findings to develop tailored
 promotions that are more likely to achieve sales goals. One major telecom company was able to reduce customer churn significantly by tracking customer account data and creating customized offerings to retain their most at-risk customers.

Production and distribution processes - Multiple Business 4.0 technologies are converging to improve and reshape the supply chain. Improvements in analytics make it easier than ever to track every item at every link in the chain, helping to spot
 fakes and prevent theft. 3D printing enables companies to move production all the way downstream, even to a customer's home or business. Synchronization among manufacturing, distribution and order fulfillment makes it feasible for companies to produce customized
 products for individual consumers. In pharmaceuticals, for example, advances in genomics and precision medicine increasingly enable the development of medicines tailored to an individual's specific genotype, which have huge potential to be more therapeutically
 effective with fewer undesirable side effects. 
Customer Service - AI technologies are helping contact center reps and field service technicians deliver higher-quality service. However, at the same time, smart, self-correcting, connected IoT products may reduce the need for human interventions.
 In other words, products ranging from cars to barbecue grills will increasingly fix themselves. Sophisticated, data-driven chatbots are handling many routine customer inquiries, thus helping companies reduce the costs of call centers by obviating the need
 for human customer support. Where human customer service reps are needed to deal with more complex situations, they can process calls better and faster when working hand-in-hand with virtual agents that have already captured all the critical information on
 the customer's issues. 
R&D - Data analytics can guide product development teams by showing them which innovations are likely to make the biggest splash in the marketplace. Remote analysis of real-world product performance can give marketing managers valuable insights on
 ways to improve quality and customer satisfaction. Sales force teams can use analytics to get location-specific visibility into how well supply and demand are matching up in their territory.

Talent management - AI also can assist with everything from hiring and development to engagement monitoring to find, motivate, and retain the best employees. AI will increasingly be used to determine which roles in a company are far more important
 than other roles, and the effectiveness with which people in those roles operate.

Finance and accounting - Analytics can help companies accelerate cash flow by automating accounts receivable and accounts payable while analyzing expenses to find ways to reduce costs.

Many companies will be tempted to use technology to make incremental improvements to their existing business processes. But a machine first delivery model calls on companies to rethink each element of their business.
Using the powerful AI, automation, cloud, analytics, and IoT tools at their disposal, companies have a golden opportunity to rethink their business model, which customers they should target, what products and services they should
 develop for those customers, as well as how they should create demand and manage supply.
Many companies will be tempted to use technology to make incremental improvements to existing business processes. But a machine first delivery model requires rethinking each element
 of their business.
How to Implement a Machine First Delivery ModelTM
The first step is to consider new business models that would allow the company to compete within a digital ecosystem that includes not only major players like Google and Facebook, but also hundreds of smaller competitors and startups.
Next, companies should look into introducing new products and services. In all cases, the focus should be treating technology as a means to achieving desired outcomes, not as an end itself.
For example, the retail industry is ultimately about delivering goods to customers in their homes. Among other benefits (such as promoting its Prime Service) Amazon saw an opportunity to use its 2017 Whole Foods acquisition to enhance
 the value of its Alexa virtual assistant by allowing users to order groceries via Alexa, while establishing distribution centers for the groceries that those users order.
In the automotive industry, manufacturers such as Ford, BMW and Toyota are responding to the growth of the sharing economy and companies such as Uber and Lyft. They are looking for ways to expand beyond manufacturing and supplying
 cars toward reinventing themselves as mobility companies that get people from A to B by using IoT systems to monitor automobiles and make software fixes/downloads automatically (as Tesla, among others, have begun doing). And to keep customers happy, automakers
 have started dispatching technicians to repair cars at customers' homes and offices, rather than making customers disrupt their day by driving to a service center and leaving their car for repairs.
This essentially amounts to a digital redefinition of an industry. It will have huge implications for companies whose products can be digitized 100% (think media, entertainment, and financial services). In the real estate sector,
 mobile app provider Zillow has moved from providing home price estimates to generating leads for real estate agents. That's easy for Zillow to do given that its site has 151 million visitors every month.4 More recently, the $1 billion (revenue)
 company has been partnering with banks to provide mortgages to its users. And in August, it entered the mortgage origination business itself through an acquisition.5
It's useful to think about Zillow's digital journey-from data provider to mortgage underwriter. It entered the digital marketplace in 2006 as an online database of homes in the U.S. It produced a highly popular mobile app that let
 home buyers to preview homes for sale as they walk or drive about, street by street. Now, with more than 100 million app users,6 it is providing more value to its home buying shoppers: helping them get through the onerous mortgage loan process.
 That is a huge opportunity for Zillow, especially given that the share of U.S. home mortgage money loaned by the three biggest U.S. banks fell from 50% of all new mortgage lending in 2011 to 21% by September 2016. The 10 biggest mortgage lenders by volume
 are now non-banks (e.g., Quicken Loans). Only two were in the top 10 in 2011.7
Financial services firms around the world are encountering uncommon, and often digitally unfettered competitors. And many established banks are fighting back successfully.
After determining a new business model (as Zillow did for its business), the next step is to design and build the business processes necessary to support those new products and services. Here the focus always should be on delivering
 a superior customer experience, for example through AI-enabled and digitally sophisticated chatbots that can handle issues by knowing customer histories and respond accordingly in a human manner.
Of course, it's important to put security at the heart of any new digital offerings or business process. The machine first delivery model relies on collecting and analyzing massive amounts of customer data. That data needs to be protected,
 and it's much better to integrate security into system architecture from the start rather than trying to bolt it on after the fact.
One benefit of cloud computing is that patch management and security updates can be delivered remotely and automatically to distributed systems. This can help companies maintain regulatory compliance while protecting both software
 and hardware from bad actors.
As companies develop these new systems, models, products, services, and processes they will need to adopt agile, automated systems to minimize disruptions to existing core businesses.
But the next step will be to empower and reskill the IT function. That will enable IT professionals to play an even bigger role in the transformation of their company. We'll explore that in more detail next.

Where We Tested the Machine first Approach First: On Ourselves
For years, TCS leaders have believed there is no better way to test a new consulting approach
 than to test it on ourselves. Toward that end, we launched several initiatives in the last two years to refine and improve our machine first delivery approach to digital transformation. Those initiatives have already had significant impacts in two areas: talent
 development and energy usage. 
Let's look at talent development. Since we are in the business of helping large, global companies transform themselves with digital and other technologies, it would be very easy for our employees' skillsets to become outdated. Since
 2010, a number of technologies have been turning out to be crucial to many companies: big data and analytics tools, digital sensors and other Internet of Things technologies, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, among them. And yet the supply of highly
 skilled people in those arenas remains relatively small, as it does for any new or fast-evolving technology.
In addition to finding that talent, TCS management also believes highly in retraining current employees. It's a philosophy that has helped us more than double our revenue since 2011, to $19 billion, and double our headcount, to nearly
 400,000 today.
We have trained 260,000 of those employees to improve their skills in these emerging digital areas through digital learning. We took a machine first approach beginning in 2015 to internal training and development. Prior to that, internal
 training was largely through traditional classroom lectures at our facilities worldwide. We realized that this would be the slow, highly expensive and often not highly effective approach to learning new consulting and technology skills.

As a result, we have redesigned our training and development processes from scratch. We took our classroom training content and converted it into online modules. We now have an immense digital learning platform with more than online
 350 courses and 139 guided tutorial sessions. (From that platform, we issue 470 certifications to our people.) Over the last nine months alone, some 23,000 associates in 23 countries have developed new competencies in key digital areas such as analytics, Internet
 of Things, cloud, agile, and machine learning.
Online training-delivered just when an employee needs it (and not when a classroom session is offered), and at a convenient place (wherever they are sitting)-has proven to be hugely successful to TCS and its employees.
The second place in which we have applied a machine first design approach is energy management. Our company has a huge electricity bill-in the millions of dollars. (We have 120 large buildings across India from which we deliver many
 of our services. In all, we have operations in 46 countries, and nearly 150 delivery centers.) Our Indian facilities collectively house about 275,000 TCS people-about 10% of the population of Chicago-and they work in aggregate space that is five times the
 capacity of the world's tallest building: the 160-story Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
In total, TCS' more than 120 facilities in India were consuming 500 MWh units of electricity annually. By using machine first principles and technologies such as IoT, cloud, and analytics, we instituted energy-saving practices such
 as automatic shutdowns of light and heat in unoccupied spaces. This year's total electricity bill will remain the same as last year's even though we have increased our floor space 15%.
We have many other machine first initiatives at TCS, including in human resources (especially in using social media to recruit new employees across the world), finance and our internal IT function (we have 50 data centers across India).
 We expect the returns on them to be just as substantial, and in some cases, even more.


The Machine First Delivery Model: Four Keys for IT Management

One of the biggest transitions for a company to make in a machine first digital transformation will be in the IT function. Specifically, the IT group will need to make four fundamental changes in the way it operates (if it hasn't
 already done so):

Making data ubiquitous. The first aspect of making data ubiquitous in a company is identifying all the data
 it needs to run a superior business. Much of this data is in the hands of other parties in its ecosystem: suppliers, partners, customers, and other external parties. Walmart's ecosystem includes suppliers (e.g., Procter & Gamble) and distribution partners
 that are key elements in making products available in the right quantities and at the right times in Walmart stores. Once they seamlessly combine such ecosystem data with internal data, companies that design their business with a machine first approach do
 not hoard or isolate that data. Instead, they give real-time data to employees at all levels, when and where they need it. As one CIO of a large pharmaceutical company has said, the way to avoid ""the finger-pointing between business and IT on data is by making
 data available to everyone.""8 But data alone is not sufficient. The IT function needs to provide analytics tools, as well as the insights about the company (and customers, suppliers, etc.) that those tools generate, throughout the company. For example,
 having deep insights about exactly why customers buy from a company is crucial to that company's marketers, sales force, customer service agents, R&D, and finance (if the pricing group sits there), among others.
Embracing polymorphic analytics and other uses of digital data. Following the Greek meaning
 of the term (having multiple forms), polymorphic in this context is about tailoring analytics applications to the needs of managers and other workers, function by function. Each C-suite executive in a company has his or her own key metrics. The IT function
 must tailor data analytics tools to each of their needs. For example, analytic tools for CFOs should bring unprecedented insights on cash flow, margins, and risks. A chief operating officer would need analytics tools tuned to such metrics as the customer experience,
 customer satisfaction, and on-time delivery of orders. Then, those executives must be trained on how to use the tools. If they aren't, the insights are likely to go untapped. Here's an example: At the Mall of America in Minnesota, mapping Wi-Fi data allows
 mall retailers to identify customer movement through the facility and optimize their offerings to attract them, as well as use weather data to predict mall traffic. But such data is only valuable if the mall's business users (including store managers) become
 ""power users"" as the Mall's IT director says.9
Maintaining a focus on customer needs. As machine first companies embrace advanced technologies,
 they must guard against getting so wrapped up in the wizardry of technology that they lose track of their core mission: to satisfy internal and external customer needs and exceed their expectations. In all cases, a machine first delivery model should also
 be business-first; technology should be deployed first in the service of the business, not to make things easier for the IT function (although a lot of simplification needs to be done there too).
Embedding security in every system. Because the machine first delivery model is based on the
 proper use of data, companies that adopt the approach must take extra care to make sure their data is protected from both external and internal threats.
As machine first companies embrace advanced technologies, they must guard against getting so wrapped up in the wizardry of technology that they lose track of their core mission: to
 satisfy customers.
Machine First Won't Mean Machine-Only
Employees have understandable concerns that AI, machine learning, robotics, and other technologies that
 enable automation will eliminate their jobs. However, history suggests that new technologies create more jobs than they destroy. In the 1800s, agriculture accounted for almost 75% of jobs in America. The mechanization of farming associated with the industrial
 revolution did cause a 25% decline in farm-related jobs by 1890, but it did not lead to widespread unemployment, because new jobs opened up in other fields-including jobs associated with the design, manufacturing, sales, and repair of industrial farm equipment.
By 2030, for example, McKinsey Global Institute predicts that automation could displace some 400 million workers worldwide, but that other catalysts including rising demand for health care from aging populations and new investments
 in infrastructure and energy should still generate demand for up to 890 million new full-time equivalent positions.10
It is true that some companies generate more revenue today than they did decades ago despite employing many fewer workers. At the same time, even leading digital-first companies like Amazon are investing heavily in retaining and adding
 employees.11 In the first quarter of 2018, Amazon employed more than half a million people, up more than 50% from the first quarter of 2017.12
The machine first approach is based on using automation, AI, and other advanced technologies to enhance the work of people, not to displace them. Indeed, much work based on manual labor will be automated. But that labor needs to be
 assigned to the new jobs and tasks of a company, which we believe will be bountiful.
Unlike in previous eras, where the brute force of steam engines and gasoline motors replaced human muscle power, the Business 4.0 era will be defined by the combination of human ingenuity with machine speed and power. Humans will
 be the guiding force helping the machines make good judgments and respond to novel situations.
Humans and machines are already delivering impressive results in the field of robotic surgery. The machine's precision reduces complications and enables faster recovery, but it is human intelligence that still guides the robotic arm.13
More broadly, human-machine collaboration allows machines to take on dangerous, unpleasant, or monotonous tasks, while freeing humans to concentrate on the creative, intellectual work that produces higher-value products and services.
 While humans performing monotonous tasks may make mistakes due to boredom and a lack of concentration, regularly-maintained machines can continue to perform the same functions at the same high quality day after day on an indefinite basis.
Even the media industry has seized opportunities to leverage the power of AI. The Associated Press news wire agency has used AI to automate the production of simple, repetitive news stories on topics such as corporate earnings reports
 and the results of ball games, freeing reporters to focus on more complex and interesting articles.14
We see many opportunities for companies to improve and replace laborious and often dangerous manual work, for example:
In manufacturing, machines can take on physically difficult or dangerous tasks while humans assume monitoring
 and control responsibilities. This division of labor can dramatically reduce health and safety risks for the human workforce while improving productivity. As machines get more advanced and adaptable, they can be reconfigured on the fly to produce new or redesigned
 products. This human-machine collaboration should dramatically accelerate the speed with which companies can bring products to market, delivering major ROI benefits to companies that can seize first-mover advantages.
Human-machine collaboration should dramatically accelerate the speed with which companies bring products to market.
In accounts receivable, machine-human collaboration can help solve the problem of rampant late
 payments. In 2017, nearly 49% of B2B invoices in the U.S.,Mexico, Canada and Brazil were overdue.15 Machine learning can automate what is currently a highly labor-intensive process of matching invoices with purchase orders. Machines can learn to
 handle receipts and invoices according to each company's collection policies. Algorithms can be written that classify receivables and prioritize accounts for collection based on variables such as customer history and invoice data. By extrapolating credit-risk
 rules from large data sets, machine learning can accurately spot warning signs of credit/payment problems and prioritize those accounts for action.
In warehousing and distribution, robots and other smart machines (including drones)
 can make warehouses run more efficiently and streamline delivery processes.
In IT departments, automated software distribution, deployment, and patch updates can liberate
 developers and engineers to focus on developing new products and services.

Barriers and Benefits
Every major technological change is met with resistance. The machine first delivery model will be no different.
Companies will need to invest in reskilling and retraining employees. Retraining efforts should focus on teaching people the skills they will need to perform their new jobs in collaboration with intelligent machines. The IT function
 must transition from a reactive to a proactive role. Instead of fulfilling orders and meeting demand, the IT function must be prepared to provide best-practice advice and guidance to colleagues in each functional area.
At the same time, companies should look for opportunities to have humans leverage their domain knowledge to help machines get better at their tasks and make automated systems more useful.
The machine first delivery model will be disruptive, but it will not-if correctly implemented- disrupt the large employee base in most industries. Instead, it will make their own work lives more human, not less.

"
60,"To
 thrive in a world of customers who demand personalized customer experiences and digitally sophisticated competitors that can provide them (part of the today's digital landscape that we call Business 4.0TM), companies need immense amounts of computing
 power. To be sure, they may not need this power all the time.
More often, they require it at periods of peak demand - for example, when millions of customers are flocking to their website at the same time. Or when they must transmit massive amounts of digits to customers at the spur of the moment.
 (Think streaming videos, one of the biggest digital data hogs of all time.)
For many big companies, buying the computing gear necessary to process such enormous data loads has become prohibitive. If the cost isn't too high, finding the IT people who know how to manage the data tsunamis is.
Fortunately, the remarkable decade-long ascendance of cloud computing providers now makes it possible.Large companies everywhere are relying on suppliers of immense data processing resources on demand - businesses like Amazon Web
 Services, Google, and Microsoft-as well as niche cloud players that are building deep competencies in different domains.
As a result, cloud computing has become a staple of the modern IT budget. Enterprise agility: the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.
1
None of this surprises us. Every company must now be able to deliver new digital services, or tweaks to existing services, in minutes or hours, not days. That, in turn, requires unprecedented amounts of computing power. At the same
 time, enterprises face constant pressure to reduce their data processing costs while complying with new data protection rules like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
IDC expects spending on cloud services worldwide to reach $160 billion in 2018, and that within two years more than 90% of enterprises will use multiple cloud services and platforms.
All in all, success in a Business 4.0 world hinges in part on how well a company can embrace risk to shift its systems to cloud computing vendors, and then manage the relationships. The rewards for executives who master this will
 be plentiful. By harnessing the immense computational power of cloud providers and the growing number of sophisticated tools (such as artificial intelligence and analytics) offered through the cloud, these companies will able to

make better decisions more easily delight customers develop new business models faster increase revenue more rapidly 
As a result, they have the opportunity to create exponential value for themselves and their customers.
In this article, we explain why cloud computing represents a sea change for executives, and how leaders at such companies as Cargotec Oy, Air France-KLM, Rolls Royce, and Malaysia Airlines are already embracing it. We also lay out
 a process by which they and their IT peers can determine what, when, and how to move their company's systems to the cloud.
The Cloud as Game Changer
Early implementations of cloud have already enabled companies to develop new, more profitable business models. Cloud-enabled companies can unlock new revenue channels that may not have been possible before.
For example, rather than selling tires to commercial truck fleets, Michelin now also rents them on a per-mile basis, creating a constant revenue stream.2 The reason Michelin can do this? It puts IoT sensors in its tires,
 and those tires report their usage digitally into a data center that collects the information.3 Aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls Royce has developed a cloud platform to house Internet of Things data so that it can work more closely with customers
 (airlines) and suppliers (engine component manufacturers) to improve engine performance and maintenance.
These business models are based on the continuous collection of data about how customers use a product and when those products will fail. Through the cloud, companies can analyze this data and personalize customer offers and offerings.
By generating uncommon insights through cloud-based analytics-as-a-service offerings (increasingly referred to as the ""Insight Economy""), companies can deliver timely information that customers need. Examples of this abound. Take
 TellusLabs, a satellite imagery and machine learning company that uses satellite imagery data to track the conditions of farmland in 2,000 U.S. counties. It created algorithms to predict agricultural yields, crunching huge volumes of digital data daily. In
 2016, the company predicted the country's soybean output for September of that year within 1% of the eventual output and made that prediction two months earlier than the U.S. Department of Agriculture's prediction.4
The advantages of the cloud can be found everywhere, and in every business function. Here are some of the biggest ones, which fall into four categories: superior customer experience; always on, everywhere; rapid response; and reduced
 costs.
Four Ways the Cloud is Changing the Basis of Competition



1. Enabling Superior Customer Experiences 
European airline 0giant Air France-KLM is using the cloud so that its website can handle huge volumes of customer searches for flights and fares, and so it can send automated updates on customers' social media accounts. 2017 KLM passenger
 count was a company record 32.7 million, with 88.4% seat load factor (also a company record).



2. Making Business Always On, Everywhere
Finland-based global cargo and load handler Cargotec Oyj uses the cloud to monitor conditions of key physical infrastructure and predict when equipment will need maintenance.
Impact: lower equipment downtime, improved safety, and higher customer satisfaction.


3. Ensuring Rapid Response
Aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls Royce is putting Internet of Things data in the cloud to work more closely with customers (airlines) and suppliers (engine component manufacturers) and improve engine performance and maintenance.
Goal: reduce plane downtime and increase safety.


4. Dramatically Lowering Costs
Malaysia Airlines has moved 80% of core applications to the cloud.5 It expects a 51% IT cost reduction over the next five years. It has also reduced the time to achieve certain financial processes from as many as 20 hours to
 less than 30 minutes.



Superior
 Customer Experience 
As more and more products become commodities, companies increasingly must compete on the basis of the experience they provide to customers in selecting and using their products. This trend, established 20 years ago (and dubbed then as ""The Experience Economy""
6), has been accelerating.
What's different today, however, is that the digital customer experience is as important as the non-digital one, and that they must work in tandem to delight customers. But when companies talk about creating a superior digital customer
 experience, that experience must be highly interactive with transactions (clicks for information, clicks to purchase, and so on) able to be made in no longer than a few seconds. When many customers are online and trying to make those transactions concurrently,
 that can require huge amounts of computing power.
It's a reason why European airline Air France-KLM turned to cloud computing to improve its customer website (klm.com). Dealing with very high volumes of customer searches for flights and fares, the airline realized it needed to put
 the system into a public cloud. The website's performance improved dramatically, and customer traffic increased exponentially. In 2017, KLM passenger growth reached a record 32.7 million, with a company record of 88.4% of its seats full, 1.2% more than the
 previous year.7 One of KLM's innovations (which requires enormous computing power at peak times) has been automated messages to passengers who use social media (such as Twitter and Facebook) that provide status updates on flights and missing luggage.
 ""The response from passengers was extremely positive and we were soon given the nickname of 'the social media airline,' says Jos Kerssen, KLM vice president of development passenger business.""
8
Always On, Everywhere

The cloud allows companies to operate as a multi-region, always-on enterprise. Customers may be located anywhere, and companies need to be able to serve them 24/7, even when they're far away from headquarters.
Cargotec Oyj, a multibillion-dollar global cargo and load handling provider based in Finland, uses the cloud to monitor the conditions of its key physical infrastructure.9 Sensors installed in its equipment collect data
 in real time and upload it to the cloud, where analytics software makes predictions about when the equipment will need maintenance. These insights have reduced equipment downtime and improved safety, increasing customer satisfaction.
Rapid Response

Cloud computing increases enterprise agility: the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs. When companies decide to deploy new capabilities, they can get to market faster if they are doing it in the cloud, accelerating the time to value. Cloud
 providers can quickly can provision the infrastructure needed to run the new systems
Another type of agility enabled by the cloud is when companies simulate new products and business processes. That allows them to test them without committing huge resources to build physical representations.10 Such simulation
 capability is useful not only for product R&D, it's also applicable to asset management and optimization, recruitment, and workforce deployment, customer experience, fraud detection, customer and field service, and inventory management.
Lower Costs

Cloud has enabled enterprises to reduce IT spending and the cost of systems ownership. Instead of operating data centers, they can tap the cloud for computing resources when they need them.
By 2017, TCS helped Malaysia Airlines to move 80% of its core applications to the cloud.11 The airline projects a 51% IT cost reduction over the next five years. In addition, it has reduced the time needed to run certain
 financial processes from as many as 20 hours to less than 30 minutes.
Enterprise agility: the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.
Five Steps to a Cloud-Powered Business
Businesses that embrace the cloud have many opportunities to transform their business models and their daily operations. As with any significant initiative, a successful cloud transformation requires approaching the program strategically
 and cautiously.
We advise organizations to take the following five steps to leverage the cloud:


Step 1: 
Strategy Information. 
Even though many companies already have some IT resources and applications running in the cloud, business leaders need an enterprisewide strategy to determine what kind of cloud implementation makes the most sense for the business as a whole, given its specific
 circumstances.
To formulate their cloud strategies, companies must factor in:

Their digital ambitions, for example, whether they want to launch more digital products and services, or provide digital experiences that will require enormous compute power at peak times.
Their competition, including that from digital disruptors. Regulatory compliance needs, for example, whether a country where they operate requires customer data to remain within national borders.

Next, companies should evaluate the different types of cloud implementations that are appropriate given their IT resources. Data, applications, analytics platforms, security services, and infrastructure are all candidates for cloud
 transformation. But they can be handled in different ways. The options include using a public cloud operated by a third party; a private cloud, dedicated to the enterprise and managed by its IT department or a technology partner, or a hybrid cloud, which mixes
 public and private cloud resources, or to keep some resources on premise in their data centers.
With business goals defined, and cloud options explored, business leaders can develop a business case for cloud implementation to address the company's ambitions and the impact they will have on the company's resources.
Such careful deliberation is critical as the wrong strategy can lead to lost opportunities as well as wasted money and time. IT professionals report wasting around one-third of their cloud spending.12
A cloud strategy will not necessarily put everything in the cloud. Some legacy applications may not be easily migrated. In addition, some applications will continue to run most efficiently on-premises.
Strategy formulation is the first step to assessing a company's cloud goals and use cases. But once designed, strategy is not immutable. A company's subsequent technology assessment, architecture design thinking, migration, and implementation
 processes may affect the strategy. Therefore, it makes sense to maintain a team that will work on all stages of a cloud initiative to be alert to opportunities to improve the overall results. More than half of large enterprises have a central cloud enabler
 team.13

Step 2: 
Technology assessment and architecture design. 
Once leaders define their cloud strategy, they need to deeply evaluate their company's IT landscape to determine how best to execute it. Following the assessment, they should design a cloud technology architecture to understand how all the current technology
 and data pieces will interact, whether or not they are ultimately migrated to the cloud. The technology assessment should cover every IT resource, including:

Applications Infrastructure and connectivity Data Integrations within the ecosystem Security 
If the company identifies any of the above elements as a candidate for cloud migration, the next step is to determine the path forward. For example, some applications can be lifted to the cloud with few or no alterations. Many commercial
 off-the-shelf software applications, such as office productivity software, already are available in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) version.
Other applications may require small tweaks to make their capabilities cloud-ready, while still others will need to be re-architected before they can be hosted on the cloud. Meanwhile, as noted above, some applications are not cloud
 ready, or should remain on-premises for reasons such as regulatory restrictions. This will focus cloud efforts on areas that deliver the greatest benefits in the shortest possible timeframe.
Next, companies should create a migration roadmap for each IT resource moving to the cloud. A typical large enterprise will have hundreds of applications; a ""big bang"" migration for all of them at once would be ill-advised. It is
 better to define migration phases for each resource logically grouped to be moved together. A business case for the roadmap will spell out why these steps make sense in terms of strategy, cost, and timing. Determining the right order and cadence for the migration
 is critical to its success.
When the company's IT resources have been evaluated, it's time to design a technology architecture that defines the best cloud system for each resource and that ensures network and data security. The technology architecture should
 include recommendations for the cloud model (public, private, or hybrid) and the provider for each resource, and it should incorporate security best practices as set out by the Cloud Security Alliance.

Step 3: 
Cloud Migration 
When the technology assessments and architecture design are completed, a company can begin moving IT resources to the cloud, according to the migration roadmap that it finalizes in the assessment step. Beginning with building a solid cloud foundation architecture
 in the design, most cloud migrations follow one of two approaches:
1.   A low-touch approach in migrating resources, which requires no change in the resource configuration and a straight forward ""lift-andshift"" model, using automated tools that make the process fast and seamless. About 40% of applications
 are suitable for this route.
2.   A high-touch approach that is better for migrating applications and IT resources that require some tweaking to make them cloud ready thereby, and rendering them future technology proof.

Step 4: 
Implementation 
Implementation goes hand in hand with migration, and proceeds in three distinct ways as determined by the technology assessment and migration roadmap.
As noted above, certain applications and IT resources will need to be modernized-that is, re-architected or reengineered to ensure robust performance in the cloud. For example, a company may have to modernize its consumer-facing legacy
 applications. One way to do that is through a cloud native architecture, which will ensure a superfast response to customers' changing needs.
In addition, companies will need to integrate any cloud-based IT systems with their remaining legacy on-premises enterprise IT services and processes, and with each other.
Companies also implement SaaS solutions, such as cloud ERP, CRM, and marketing systems, available from a host of providers, replacing their legacy enterprise software applications.

Step 5: 
Cloud managed services. 
Once a company has migrated systems, or operationalized new applications in cloud, it has to decide who will operate, maintain, and support them to ensure they perform as expected.
Of course, a company can keep that responsibility in-house. But this will tie up IT personnel with support work, and fewer people will be available to design, build, and test the new applications. One expected outcome of a shift to
 the cloud is to transform the company IT personnel to strategic business partners instead of only supporting the current IT infrastructure.
That's one big advantage to letting a third party run and support a company's cloud systems and apps. But there are other benefits. For one, managed services shift risk management to the service provider, which ought to have greater
 expertise than the company's in-house personnel. (If the company deems that it doesn't, it is probably the wrong provider.) In addition, cloud managed service providers may provide value-added features such as metering (tracking and measuring compute resource
 usage by individuals or groups either to better understand operational needs or reduce waste). These features would be complex for a company to implement on its own.
In any event, company leaders (especially the CIO) must decide on a common governance structure to use with their cloud services. Some global companies use different cloud vendors for different lines of business or different geographic
 units. Executives who head these units should work with the group executive management and the centralized cloud enabler team to collectively set governance policies that apply to all cloud platforms deployed within the company
This will help the company run its cloud ecosystem securely and seamlessly.
Leading the Way to the Cloud
Cloud migration is critical to digital transformation. Successful leadership in the digital era requires creative thinking, not only about new businesses and markets a firm could enter, but also how it can and should reimagine the
 way it runs its existing business.
Long-term success depends on a relentless focus on increasing value to customers. That means feeling the pulse of the customer frequently, in whatever way, and through any technology that a company can use. Rather than imitating what
 competitors are doing, they should concentrate on delivering unprecedented levels of value to their customers.
The initial shift to the cloud from on-premises technology may well be costly, and leaders will need to manage it carefully. As part of the transformation process, they must reshape the purpose and work of the IT function: from managing
 technology to strategizing how the business can use it best, and then managing the cloud vendors that deliver it.
Within IT and beyond, leaders will need to remain loyal to their top talent, even as they automate and outsource employees' current jobs. Finding new and better roles for high-performing employees will help ensure that the company
 retains their talent, energy, and expertise for the road ahead.
The cloud already powers many of the most advanced and successful companies in the world. It is enabling the digital transformation of large enterprises, readying them to compete in a Business 4.0 world. It's time for companies to
 stop thinking about the cloud and instead determine how it can dramatically improve the customer experience, revenue and profits in a rapidly digitizing business landscape.
Cloud migration is critical to digital transformation.

At a time of rampant digital disruption, CEOs are under enormous pressure to up their games. Virtually every industry is entering—or already well into—the early innings of major technology-fueled transformation.
Companies, in turn, are tasked with adopting innovative technologies, bringing in tech-savvy talent, entering new markets and overhauling business models. Given the difficulty of delivering such seismic change organically, more and more are recognizing that deal-making capability is an increasingly critical key strategic tool.
In fact, 72 percent of CEOs are considering some kind of merger, acquisition or divestiture activity in the next three years, according to results of a recent study conducted by Chief Executive and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).The top two drivers of deals? Acquiring new products or services (39%) and entering new markets/creating new business models (34%).

C-Suite executives gathered for a recent roundtable discussion on M&A activity echoed those survey findings, noting that while companies once pursued acquisitions to realize economies of scale or edge into new turf, buying into Business 4.0 tech transformation is the leading deal-making rationale today. ""For us, M&A activity is about seeing the future,"" said Mark Mlotek, chief strategic officer at Henry Schein, who described an evolution in his company’s
acquisition strategy over the past 15 years. ""We’ve done about 300 acquisitions during that period. We did
1.0, which was about scale. We did 2.0, which was geographic [expansion]. We did 3.0, which was product oriented.
And now we’re doing 4.0, which is digital.""
The sheer magnitude of the changes afoot, coupled with the pace with which they must be pursued, is driving deals aimed at jumpstarting transformation, such as Walmart’s acquisition of Jet and CVS’s deal with Aetna.
""We’re moving from vertically oriented industry constructs toward more of a horizontal orientation where value creation has no regard for industry boundaries,"" said Frank Diana, leader of the Future of Business at TCS, who
described a broadening of ecosystems. ""Think connected car, smart home,smart city - as these ecosystems evolve, there are opportunities for companies to monetize on a number of levels… The shifts that are coming require
companies to have a portfolio of innovations, and M&A is a way to drive those innovations and that portfolio.""
At the same time, deals are notoriously difficult to do well - and even harder to ace at the speed demanded by today’s competitive pressures. All too often, hoped-for synergies go unrealized as newly coupled entities grapple
with the challenges of integrating operations, including dissonant cultures and incompatible processes and platforms. Such was the case for HHHunt Corporation, where the company’s first foray into M&A growth was bumpier
than anticipated. ""We struggled because our culture is our brand and the other company’s culture just didn’t fit ours,"" recounted COO Dan Schmitt.""Looking back, we probably didn’t do our homework.""
How, then, can CEOs assess opportunities and position their companies to succeed in deal-making endeavors? Diligent preparation and orchestration across a deal’s lifecycle can go a long way toward skirting the hurdles that
typically plague transactions, agreed M&A veterans, several of whom shared strategies gleaned from experience.""You need to be disciplined,"" asserted Mlotek.""There are plenty of exciting opportunities to chase but you need to
resist chasing the wrong opportunities or the right ones where the price is [too high].""
Tom Harrison, who steered more than 200 acquisitions during his tenure as CEO and chairman of Omnicom, reported that culture was as crucial as finances in his evaluations of potential acquisitions. ""Chemistry was incredibly
important to me,"" he said. ""I would always say, ‘If you’re not the kind of person that I want to go to dinner and a
Broadway show with, chances are we aren’t going to get along and this isn’t going to work.’""
 The Culture Component
For Harrison, who sought companies where the management would remain on board and be engaged post integration, walking the halls and talking with employees was as central to the due diligence process as pouring over financial ledgers. Seeking companies that would take Omnicom in a new direction, add to its client base or deepen its competencies, he vetted each potential target for entrepreneurialism. ""Walking in and talking with the receptionist and the employees really gives you a feel for a company’s DNA,"" he said.
Dave Jordan, global head and managing partner of TCS’ Consulting & Services Integration, seconded that sentiment. ""I call that the barbecue test: Would I want them to come to the home and enjoy a beer and barbecue
with the family?"" he explained. ""I drive some of my clients crazy because I insist on a significant emphasis on socializing during the due diligence process.""
Jordan urged CEOs not to neglect this often-overlooked component of M&A success. ""Get away from the spreadsheet and spend time over dinner, golf and other events so you really get to know one another,” he advised. ""Taking
the time to build a relationship and test the chemistry is really critical because,at the end of the day, if you don’t like each other, it isn’t going to work.""
While compatibility is essential, cultural differences aren’t always an issue,noted Mlotek, who says Henry Schein draws a distinction between values and culture. “Values are immutable, they’re not up for discussion,"" he said.
""But culture can cut both ways, so we try to separate the two."" While all of the companies acquired by the healthcare product and services distribution company must share a commitment to its core values, many continue to
operate as separate divisions. ""We run 400 P&Ls with separate boards where people feel empowered and have decision-making authority within their divisions,"" Mlotek said, adding that the degree to which acquired companies
need to be integrated with existing operations often depends on the strategy behind the deal. ""When it’s about scale, you integrate, when it’s geography, you don’t.""
While bringing acquisitions into the fold can be tricky, companies that regularly acquire for scale or geographic expansion generally develop and refine a process over time, pointed out Kathleen Camilli, an independent director
with UniFirst. ""We do eight to ten acquisitions a year, usually of mom-andpop enterprises where the family that owns the company is looking to cash out,"" she said. ""We put in new equipment, digitize everything and fold them
into our operation. We rarely have any problems.""
In cases where the purpose is to acquire an inventive product or the capacity for agility, however, integration without assimilation is often the challenge. Large organizations hoping to gain an entrepreneurial or innovation
edge by acquiring younger companies often do so only to find themselves unable to nurture, let alone adopt, the very qualities that attracted them.

""We’ve seen acquisition as a way to inform the whole only work in limited cases,"" said Rob Biederman, founder and CEO of Catalant, who reported that skepticism about how integration would play out led his company to pass
on six potential deals. ""The idea that something that is one-one thousandth of the size of our company is going
to come in and make us more entrepreneurial, more digital or more nimble - it usually doesn’t work because the body rejects the transplant. We’ve seen the things that made that small company great eventually get beaten
out of it, the good people leave and the positive impact just [doesn’t happen].
Those who’ve honed their approach to acquisitions into a core competency,however, say there are ways to overcome that challenge. ""It comes down to how receptive the acquirer is to the acquisition,"" said Harrison. ""In our case
a lot of the small, digital acquisitions really did change the way we thought and did business, even though they were literally a fraction of our size. We set out to acquire the right companies, and we allowed them to influence
the way we did business.""
In fact, managed well, the acquisition process can be a cultural win-win, added Jim Reagan, CFO of Leidos, whose company merged with Lockheed Martin’s Information Systems & Global Solutions unit in a Reverse Morris Trust
transaction that created a $10 billion entity. ""The Lockheed culture that had been developed over decades had a little bit more structure than we had at Leidos,"" said Reagan, who reported that the combined company was able to work with consultants to develop a brand-new culture. ""In the process,the two separate companies identified their differences, but when we said,‘What do we want to be?’ everyone agreed we wanted to come in somewhere in between on cultural dimensions like structure and the degree of regimen to put around policies.""
Driven from the Top
One big factor in developing a successful approach to acquisition strategy and integration, added Mlotek, is leadership. ""Acquisitions are hard, and there is a natural tendency to reject them,"" he said. ""You need a CEO who is bold, who understands where the future is going and who pushes the company. It requires giving people some independence so they’re not just subsumed, and a leader who is willing to spend time connecting the dots on even the small things.""
That leadership component is even more critical at a time when so many transactions involve acquiring technical capabilities or moving companies into adjacent businesses. ""The success rate of transactions, I’d imagine, is probably lower when it’s about acquiring technology as opposed to [scale],"" noted Dave Brous, president of dental APAC and specialty solutions at Henry Schein.
Acquisitions that bring a business into an adjacent space or redefine it as a multi-industry player involve a whole different level of risk than gobbling up smaller competitors, agreed TCS’Frank Diana. ""There’s significant risk inherent to any proposition that expands a company out of its primary industry into other areas, and that can be hard for stakeholders to embrace,"" he noted. ""You’re looking at the future and you’re seeing a potential
path for future value creation or a value proposition - but it’s all brand-new stuff that an organization may have trouble absorbing.""
However, failing to incorporate M&A in a company’s transformation roadmap is just as risky, if not more so, than the potential for an acquisition stumble, agreed several CEOs, who cited dangers like being displaced by more aggressive peers or innovative upstarts. ""In a lot of spaces, if you’re operating at the $10 billion-plus scale, it’s almost impossible to do meaningful development of new products,"" said Biederman. ""Sometimes there’s just no other way to do it.""
In fact, embracing ""acquisitional risk"" may well be a competitive imperative. ""You have to redefine that risk as opportunity,"" said Harrison. ""Because you’re either going to stay in this lane and still be in it in five years or you’re going to have a vision of what this new marketplace is going to be and acquire one of the adjacencies to take your business from here to there.""
Ultimately, creating a competitive advantage in an era of Uberstyle disruption means moving beyond simply talking about adopting transformative technology to actually using it to manifest a reimagined and sustainable enterprise. Increasingly,CEOs are recognizing the advantages of buying rather than attempting to build their way into closing Business 4.0 gaps. ""The most effective CEOs understand not only the need to embrace innovative processes, systems and business models, but the role M&A can play in accelerating that process,"" said TCS’ Diana.
""At the end of the day, continuously and optimally capturing value from mergers, acquisitions and divestitures should be a part of every CEO’s playbook.""

It's hard to avoid the term ""agile"" these days. The concept is generating excitement and zealous supporters at big companies worldwide, as it should since it's helped firms like ING Bank, Amazon, online music powerhouse Spotify and TV content producer
 Netflix to flourish. In fact, Harvard Business Review, that publishing mecca for management thinkers, has devoted no fewer than eight articles to the topic since 2016, including a cover piece this year on how to use agile to create ""a truly flexible""
 large organization.1 Agile has also been the topic of bestselling books, including
The Lean Startup and Scrum.
More importantly, some companies are using agile to upend the way managers at all levels make changes to their businesses-changes that have made them faster to respond to customers and competitors, leaner, and more innovative.
However, not nearly enough senior executives deeply understand agile. That is limiting how far and wide agile methods are adopted in their firms. In fact, nearly nine out of 10 professionals surveyed this year believe their business are not highly competent
 in agile practices.2 We believe that a key reason is that top management relegates agile methods to the IT function.
This practice increasingly will put their companies at risk to competitors that have embraced agile from top to bottom. In this article, I'll explain what I believe prevents most companies from fully embracing and thus mastering agile. Then I'll offer advice
 on how to overcome such hesitation.
Where Agile Has Gotten Traction
For agile's many
 proponents, the slow embrace of it at the top of companies may seem hard to understand. The adulation around agile has been building for years. The concept emerged at the turn of the millennium, when Web-based business and online ways of doing business in
 older companies were starting to take off. Suddenly, many online businesses and processes were available to customers round-the-clock at the click of a mouse, which greatly accelerated the speed of business. To compete against the Amazons, Netflixes, and Spotifys,
 established companies had to learn how to develop new systems in weeks or months, rather than years. Today, some find they must update their systems and online processes weekly or even daily.
Software developers realized that to compete in a digital world, organizations needed to move beyond traditional development techniques such as waterfall or sequential approaches. To address this, 17 of them wrote an agile manifesto in 2001 that reimagined
 software development to be faster, more adaptive and more effective. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Spotify and Google make dozens of changes to their Web systems daily. In contrast, companies that use waterfall development may take months to make similar
 adjustments.
In the years since its inception, agile has grown ever more dominant. By 2017, 80% of U.S. federal government software projects were agile or iterative.3 Research firm Gartner predicts 80% of large enterprises will adopt agile by 2021.
Still, while agile has been embraced by software developers worldwide, for many managers it remains a new or untried concept. In 2018, fewer than half of organizations surveyed by the Project Management Institute used an agile or hybrid agile approach over
 the prior 12 months.4 Another study found that while most senior executives don't embrace agile, the concept is usually highly effective in other parts of their organizations.5
Agile is particularly important for certain types of businesses, especially those with digital products or legions of customers who buy their products online. Of course, this includes companies like Facebook, Google, Netflix and Spotify, but also banks,
 newspapers and airlines. The need for agile is less obvious yet still important in industries that rely on personalized digital marketing campaigns. Other industries where agile has taken hold include those that use self-service websites in customer service.
 USAA, which offers insurance and other financial services to military families, has more than 500 agile teams and plans to add another 100 in 2018.6 Likewise, Netherlands-based bank ING has assigned most of its 3,500 fulltime employees to agile
 teams.7 
Senior Executive Resistance to Agile
Despite agile's
 momentum and many documented benefits, many senior executives have ignored it. I have found three primary reasons for this: skepticism, incomprehensibility and career threats. Let's go into each one:


Skepticism. Executives have seen years of corporate improvement programs before. Many have receded, only to be replaced by new ""vital"" tools. Remember re-engineering, pay-for performance and the balanced
 scorecard? These have come and gone over time, and seasoned executives inevitably have grown jaded. They may see agile as the latest management fad-a distraction to be resisted.

Incomprehensibility. Agile brings a new and extensive vocabulary that executives must learn. The large and growing list of agile terms includes scrum, Kanban, DevOps, lean, minimum viable product (MVP),
 sprints, extreme programming, backlog grooming, burndown charts, burnup charts, and the scaled agile framework.8 While developers and agile teams have found these terms useful, executives are likely to see them as opaque and off-putting jargon.

Career threats. If you are accustomed to wielding power, you could view the idea that teams manage themselves, rather than being directed from above, as subversive. How does an executive justify her position
 and compensation if she delegates key decisions to those under her? What distinguishes her from the rank-and-file employee? There's also the fear of dispensing with pyramid-style hierarchy and reorganizing into small agile squads-particularly when managers
 are confronted with the thought of dozens of such squads running around. 
To master agile, however, its proponents must help skeptical executives overcome their resistance. Agile management requires buy-in not just from software developers but from the entire company. Managers at every level and in most business functions must
 embrace the new way of working. A world in which competitors can make important changes to products, services and processes in weeks or days-or hours, in the case of digital assets-forces companies to dramatically accelerate key decisions and actions.
An ecommerce site that cannot promptly fix an interface that customers find frustrating will no doubt lose them to the likes of Amazon, whose agile teams constantly improve the customer experience and whose developers can implement multiple software updates
 each day.
The adoption of agile methods is also critical in industries whose physical products contain a growing digital component. These include cars with telematics and onboard infotainment systems, and aircraft engines, power turbines and other industrial equipment,
 which increasingly come fitted with sensors and predictive analytics. Agile methods are also now vital in industries where the customer experience is the product. Disney, for example, is improving the customer experience at its Orlando, Fla., theme park using
 agile management and extensive data collected from the MagicBand wrist bands that visitors wear.
Over the next few years, as more and more large enterprises reorganize into highly responsive agile teams, the list of industries that must embrace agile will grow. Top managers who don't support and master agile methods will become problematic.
Getting Leadership Buy-In
From our
 experience in helping dozens of companies make the transition to agile, we have observed three measures that can greatly improve the chances of success.
1. Focus
 on the Benefits, Not the Approaches - Successful agile advocates present specific outcomes, in dollars and cents. They convince executives that it will improve operational performance (and therefore help them) before addressing how those results will be
 achieved. Showing executives the business impact of agile in financial and operational terms will greatly reduce skepticism. Look for stories like these:


Deploying agile to save an oil services firm - In 2015, oil services engineering and construction firm WorleyParsons found itself in crisis. With the price of oil plummeting, demand for its services declined
 substantially. Successive rounds of cuts didn't solve the problem. Using agile squads, sprints, backlog prioritization and daily huddles, the company attacked the cost base. It implemented a wide range of changes, from overhauling the IT infrastructure to
 banning business class travel to accelerating responses to RFPs to fixing inefficiencies. In only 100 days, the firm increased its cash position 20%. In the first year, it saved $400 million on a $1.2 billion cost base, and margins increased by 5 percentage
 points. The equity markets noticed: Its stock rose fourfold.9 
Building the world's most cost-effective fighter jet - Executives who believe agile is better suited to a Silicon Valley startup than a complex organization should consider the Gripen fighter jet's fuselage, one of the world's
 most complex products. Saab Aeronautics uses more than 100 cross-functional agile teams, working in three-week sprints, to build the fuselage. To promote efficiency, the company has a daily process for identifying issues. ""At 7:30 a.m. each frontline agile
 team holds a 15-minute meeting to flag impediments, some of which cannot be resolved within that team. At 7:45 a.m., those impediments are escalated to a team of teams, where leaders either fix them or further escalate issues. This approach continues, and
 by 8:45 a.m., the executive action team has a list of the critical issues it must resolve to keep progress on track.""10 The result, according to an influential industry publication, is that the Gripen has been dubbed the world's most cost-effective
 fighter jet.11 
Research has correlated agile management with strong results-financial and otherwise. Some 95% of finance executives reported revenue growth after adopting agile methods, while only 70% of non-agile leaders reported growth, according to a study by the American
 Institute of CPAs and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (AICPA/CIMA).12 (See Figure 1). Practitioners of Scrum, the most popular agile methodology, estimate the approach is successful 62% of the time.13 Other research has shown that
 the agile methods can speed time to market by 90%, increase sales-staff productivity 30%, and increase time spent on value-adding activities such as innovation, customer interaction, and problem solving by 130%.14

2. Describe Senior Management's
 New and Important Role
In addition to showing the benefits of agile, its proponents must communicate the key role of top management in mastering agile. This should reduce fears about the impact of agile on executives' careers and status. It also helps to describe the practices these
 leaders will need to stay effective.
The role of leadership in an agile organization is markedly different. Rather than making great decisions, agile leaders help teams make great decisions. Rather than exercising authority based on rank, experience and expertise,
 leaders must treat people as equals and empower them. Leaders must shift the culture from one that doesn't permit mistakes (and thus, at its extreme, operates on fear) to one in which failures are tolerated, lessons from those failures are celebrated, and
 changes are put in motion rapidly.15
In short, the role of a leader in an agile organization is to create strategy and empower, rather than micromanage.
Senior leaders must establish guidelines that agile squads can apply and operate within. For example, the marketing department of a multinational oil and gas company developed parameters for social media campaigns focusing on controversial
 environmental issues. After top management defined the campaign standards and objectives, regional and local agile teams quickly tailored messages for their markets.16
3. Write Your
 Company's Agile Manifesto
The final step is to write your own agile manifesto for your company's leaders-both the C-suite and the board. Unlike the Agile Manifesto of 2001 (which focused on agile methods), your agile manifesto must explore the potential business impacts of agile (in
 revenue and profit), and point to where this has already happened in similar companies, competitors and others.
Your messages must be clear. Speaking about agile in everyday terms will reduce its incomprehensibility to those who don't use the language every day. Avoid acronyms and use the vernacular of business, not software. For instance,
 instead of using terms familiar to developers like ""servicesoriented architecture"" (SOA), explain that the goal is to develop small pieces of software, each of which focuses on a key business task.
You must liberally use real business examples to illustrate and prove the value of agile. Be sure to invoke the names of highly respected companies and well-regarded CEOs, division heads, etc., who have become big proponents.
To get you started, here are some examples 


Netflix-Among its many accomplishments, perhaps the most impressive is the rapid rise of its original content. In 2018, just five years after launching ""House of Cards,"" Netflix scored the largest number
 of Emmy Award nominations (112), a distinction that had been held by HBO the previous 17 years. How did an upstart conquer a highly competitive, established industry in so little time? The answer: fast feedback, iterative changes, and cross-collaboration-all
 core agile concepts. Instead of releasing pilots to see if a concept will work, Netflix tests and reviews projects under development to improve the chances its shows connect with audiences.17 Using agile techniques, Netflix also individualizes marketing
 campaigns. The company produces multiple personalized trailers for programs and screens them with members based on data of their viewing habits.18 These techniques have helped Netflix rise to dominance. The service is watched more than any other
 platform, including basic cable and broadcast. It released 452 hours of original programming in the second quarter of 2018, up more than 50% year-over-year.19

ING Bank,like most banks, does not have its roots in technology. Yet several years ago, it foresaw the mounting threat from financial technology firms and recognized that agile methodologies made these
 startups more responsive. ING reorganized itself into agile squads in which business IT and employees collaborated, ""constantly testing what they might offer our customers, in an environment where there are no managers controlling the handovers and slowing
 down collaboration,"" according to CIO Peter Jacobs. ING also did away with steering committees, project managers and agility-killing silos. The results: faster time to market, stronger employee engagement, and increased productivity. Rather than having five
 or six big online product launches per year, the company goes live with new releases every two weeks or so. That has helped ING deliver stellar online customer experiences.20

Nestle's Digital Acceleration Team has used agile techniques to manage global social media for its 2,000 brands. The approach has enabled the company to scale up its 24/7 social media presence across the
 world, and increase followers to more than 170 million consumers. It has also driven company innovation. As a result, e-commerce for Nestle accounts for 4% of sales.21,22

Amazon is arguably one of the most innovative companies, ever. Not coincidentally, it was built on agile, and CEO Jeff Bezos pins the company's success on the concept. ""In today's era of volatility,"" he
 has said, ""there is no other way but to re-invent. The only sustainable advantage you can have over others is agility, that's it. Because nothing else is sustainable, everything else you create, somebody else will replicate.""23 Like Netflix, Amazon
 immerses itself in the data that its vast website generates. It constantly tests new ideas, both small and big-hence Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Business, as well as the occasional failure, such as the Fire Phone. Despite
 the market dominance of its e-commerce interface, developers are constantly testing potential site updates to understand how consumers will respond. The data these squads obtain helps ensure that new releases are successful. And in rolling out new software,
 Amazon's nimbleness is unmatched in e-commerce. Despite its complexity, Amazon has structured its software so it can make many changes to its website each day.

Electric carmaker Tesla is also built on agile techniques, and is engineered to make change easy. It created interfaces so that each component of its cars can be modified independently. The bumper team
 can change its design, so long as it maintains the interface with the parts it affects. Rather than waiting for waterfall-style major releases, the company makes about 20 engineering changes each week, to improve both production and performance.24

Why You Need to Start Penning Your Agile Manifesto Today
Agile is making a real difference in how managers and workers improve products and processes. If top management at your company resists agile, now is the time to write your own agile manifesto for them.
But be sure to make it a lively read, grounded in facts and figures of agile's business impact at market-leading companies. Your manifesto must be understood by the lay person, not just by the agile advocates. And it needs to clearly explain the vital role
 that senior management will play in an agile enterprise.
You can save the mechanics of how a scrum works for later, after you win buy-in at the top. And after they see boost financial performance, you'll be surprised how agile friendly they get.

"
66,"
As digital transformation takes hold across all industries, company leaders must dramatically shift their thinking. They are leaving a business world of constraints and entering an Age of Abundance: of digital data and the technology
 tools to create innovations from that data.
Every large company today is swimming in a rising tide of digital data. That data resides in their information systems. But it also resides in the ecosystem that surrounds them - the data of suppliers, distribution channel partners, and others with which
 they do business.
The sources and types of data are rising at an exponential pace. Some 90% of the world''s digital data today has been created in the last two years alone. By itself, the U.S. produces an average of more than 2.6 million gigabytes of Internet data every minute,
 a number that figures to increase as the world of connected devices grows.1 Soon, people will be routinely talking about ""zettabytes"" - 1 trillion gigabytes of digital data - a concept that would have been unfathomable only a few years ago.
As the world's population surges, data will not only change companies and whole industries, it will be the key to addressing societal issues like managing traffic, growing food, and feeding countries. Indeed, IT researcher International Data Corp. (IDC)
 Predicts that by the end of this year, half of large enterprises will be selling the digital data they generate in their businesses, as well as metrics, insights, and recommendations on what to do with it.2
For a case study in leveraging data effectively, consider ABB, the $34.3 billion industrial firm that services power plants and automates industrial processes. The company credits its ABB Ability platform of services3 with driving an 11% increase
 in orders for its software and services in 2017.4 The platform collects real-time data, analyzes and monitors conditions at industrial facilities (such as factories, oil wells, and power plants) to reduce operating costs, and improve safety and
 maintenance. ABB estimates the platform offers the potential for $20 billion in annual sales in the future.5
While those prospects may be tantalizing, other research indicates most enterprises are neither getting enough from their current data nor preparing themselves to tap into the new data that will soon be available.6
There is plenty of technology and expertise today to help companies capitalize on their digital data. But most of it goes untapped because there's a shortage of something else: imagination. In short, too many companies lack the capabilities of generating
 insights from their data - i.e., of creating profound new observations about what customers want, why they buy, what they like and don''t like about a company's current offerings and the purchase and post-purchase experiences they provide with their offerings,
 and much more.
When companies are data-rich but insight-poor, innovation suffers. Ideas for new products, services and business processes are episodic and often off-target.

Widespread Weakness: A Lack of Data Maturity
The root of this problem is clear to us. These companies lack strong capabilities in analyzing data.
In a survey of 196 organizations around the world, Gartner found that 91% had not yet reached a ""transformational"" level of maturity in data and analytics, despite this being the top investment priority for CIOs in recent years.7 Indeed, 60% of
 those surveyed rated themselves average or below average when it came to data maturity.
What exactly does it mean to lack maturity in data analysis? People throughout an organization don't share data. Companies also don't take full advantage of the data that business partners collect.
What's more, companies with immature analytics capabilities operate in ""data fiefdoms"" where pockets of insight-generating analytics benefit only one part of the organization.
The experience of Monsanto, the $14.6 billion agricultural and biotech company, illustrates the benefits of sharing data and expertise across functional boundaries. To increase revenue and improve profitability, Monsanto launched a cloud analytics platform
 it calls ""science@scale."" The platform enables the company's data experts and scientists to collaborate, and it has accelerated the development of analytics-driven decision models, says Monsanto CIO James Swanson.8 And because the platform enables
 scientific work to be done in hours rather than months, the company estimates it has saved $15 million in operating costs and boosted revenue by $17 million.
Becoming Data- and Insight-Rich Begins at the Top


The minority of companies today that generate game-changing insights from their digital data operate quite differently than the rest. That difference begins at the top of the organization, with a leadership team that worships digital data. We call this having
 a data-centric statement of purpose. Leaders believe analytics and data are the foundation of their company's digital transformation, and that they are the source superior customer experiences and superior new product/service offerings.
Leaders then must determine exactly how the insights from both internal and external data can create new opportunities. They need to first assess their organization's data maturity (existing data inventory, what the company should capture and analyze), and
 then map out how to reach the target state.
This must include determining how valuable insights can be shared across the organization, which often requires eliminating cultural barriers that prevent such sharing.
Three Sources of Data to Harvest
In our work, we found three sources of digital data that many companies don't fully tap:
■  Existing, siloed data. Companies often have data that provides tremendous
 value to one business function such as marketing, but is not shared with other functions that could gain similar value from it. This data must be made available in digital form to be analyzed by anyone within the organization. This is easier than it sounds.
 Disconnected data in U.S. and U.K. companies create waste, duplications of efforts and missed opportunities, according to a survey of 500 IT decision makers and business application users by market research firm Vanson Bourne.9 Nearly three-quarters
 (72%) believe their organization is missing out on opportunities because of data silos. More than half (56%) feel those silos are obstacles to meeting business objectives while 47% believe disconnected data hampers innovation.
■  Missing internal data. Companies capture only a small percentage of the
 data from their operations-data that is within their control. Companies that are insight-rich typically collect data from their operations that competitors aren't capturing in their own businesses.

Further, many organizations outsource some of their business operations to third party vendors. During such operations, the service providers collect large volumes of data. However, vendors may not have a mechanism to make data effectively available to their
 partner organizations to take informed business decisions. In addition, these partners may not have advanced technologies to collect all relevant data points that have a bearing on customer experience.

For instance, airline companies generally outsource the wheelchair operations to service providers, who may not use Internet of Things (IoT) or mobility solutions to manage the operations on a real-time basis. As a result, airline companies may potentially
 fail to collect and analyze valuable data points, which otherwise would have helped them positively address their customer experience initiatives or operational delays.

This principle is applicable across all major industries. Take for example, the oil and gas industry. In a hazardous environment such as an oil exploration site, improving personnel and equipment safety is paramount. Therefore, it is crucial to collect data
 that helps industry players improve processes, makes more-informed business decisions, and manages safety, maintenance, and costs. Frequency of data collection will also play a crucial role in meeting the business objectives.
■  New kinds of external data. The data marketplace provides all sorts of information that,
 properly used, can create tremendous value. The growing data brokerage industry, which collects and markets data on consumers' habits, is expected to reach the $250 billion mark in 2018.10
For example, ride-share and taxi services in India can identify the restaurants and establishments where people eat. That data could be sold to other restaurants and businesses that want these people to buy their products and services. The offers, based
 on insights about customers' dining histories and locations, create opportunities to collaborate in an urban area digital ecosystem, one that could enhance customer experiences and expand sales.
New data can come from unexpected places-like washing machines. Consider WASH Multifamily Laundry Systems, an El Segundo, Calif.-based laundry facilities management service provider with 75,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada. It collects a vast amount
 of data from its extensive network of hundreds of thousands of interconnected washer, dryers, vending machines, and payment systems. Working with apartmentbuilding owners, WASH uses this data to model and test manager's questions, such as whether it is cost-effective
 to switch from cash to payment cards, before committing to changes.11
New types of public-private partnerships are evolving in this age of abundant data. The Dutch capital of Amsterdam uses GPS data from mobile and navigation devices, gathered by a private company, to create models to study traffic issues in the city.12
 The possibilities that come from having almost limitless access to information are often just the constraints of imagination and will.
Making Data Easier to Use


Digital data is not the only product that is abundant today. So are people who can make sense of the data. This may sound counterintuitive, given an acute shortage of data scientists, statisticians and other professionals sought by companies near and far
 to analyze ""Big Data.""
Companies today have numerous people without PhDs in statistics or data science but who have deep familiarity with customers and business processes. In many enterprises, they are an underutilized resource in generating insights from data.
Today, analytics are largely dependent on having people with advanced analysis capabilities to manage data, create algorithms, and take other steps to turn data into insight. While this approach could work in the past when companies had smaller data sets
 and the pace of business was slower, it is inadequate at a time when data is abundant.
To begin with, data is growing so fast that hiring and training enough experts to keep up with the onslaught of information is impossible. Depending on a core of analytics experts creates a bottleneck. It prevents an organization from scaling its use of
 data.
Instead, companies must embrace the democratization of analytics, where data tools are used by people with varying degrees of analytics expertise at all levels of the organization. It requires new technologies that make analytics simpler such as machine
 learning and new programming languages like Python or quantum computing.
Quantum computing has been the talk of the industry for some time now. Unlike current systems, quantum computers are able to complete complex tasks at a fraction of the time consumed by contemporary processing systems. This opens up new opportunities in
 terms of real-time data processing.
Consider a wealth management firm. Financial advisors rely on research to design investment plans for their high-net-worth clients. As the process generally involves complex calculations, traditional data mining solutions are used. However, lack of data
 processing in real-time could potentially affect the revenue and hence the performance of the financial firm. In such scenarios, the firm can use quantum computing to process and analyze both structured and unstructured data to improve the client experience
 by, for example, providing both personalized service and rapid responses to customer questions about investments. This capability makes the firm more agile, better able to respond to market conditions, and drive business growth.
Farmers Insurance is another example. The insurance firm is using an AI platform called DataRobot to bring machine-learning techniques to a team that analyzes customer behavior and examines the designs of different insurance policies.13

The second improvement is around data interfaces. Just as analytics technologies must be easier to use, the democratization of analytics hinges on making the use of data simpler and more intuitive. For example, organizations could create models where people
 talk to an AI-based system like Amazon's Alexa, in which they verbally ask for and receive information they need.
New data presentation tools, such as mixed reality and augmented reality (AR), can also help. They present data in an intuitive, visual manner. This is already happening in many industries. Logistics company DHL tested smart glasses and AR in a warehouse
 in the Netherlands. Workers guided through the warehouse by graphics displayed on the smart glass were able to speed the picking process and reduce errors, boosting efficiency by 25%.14
Lowes, the large home improvement retail chain in the U.S., is experimenting with VR headsets to help their customers visualize furnishings for a kitchen remodel.15

ThyssenKrupp, an elevator manufacturer, is using Microsoft's HoloLens to visualize an elevator repair before the technician reaches the site. Onsite, technicians can use augmented reality to view digital overlays of manuals and repair guides while they fix
 the elevator.16
This type of technology is extending to a vast array of purposes and industries. Ford is using virtual reality (VR) to create virtual models of cars and enable designers to better collaborate on design changes. The technology reduces the need to build physical
 prototypes and allows the engineers to more easily explore creative designs.17 Cosmetics companies are testing their products by creating ""digital twins"" of animal skin, so they can see the reaction to test products in a virtual environment without
 harming animals.
As these examples attests, the pathway to the Age of Abundance depends on subtraction and addition: removing human beings from the data preparation process, while augmenting human beings so they can more effectively use that data.
Overcoming the Barriers to Generating Game-Changing Insights


Every company today needs to determine how it will gain crucial insights from the vast and growing amount of digital data it can tap. But the biggest barriers are not technological ones. In fact, they are primarily cultural.
Liberating data so it can be effectively harnessed is largely a change-management exercise that must account for the many ways, and many reasons, that data is not widely shared and used. We have found five cultural barriers and one technology management
 hurdle to leveraging data in many organizations.
■  Data Held Captive. Departments can be reluctant to relinquish it for a
 number of reasons. They are concerned that the information can be misused or tampered with. The data sharing might also reveal mistakes, such as a bank ignoring some regulatory rules to onboard customers faster. The data sharing can also erase competitive
 advantages one business line may have over others that compete for the same customers.
■  Too Many Data Choices. Companies have the potential to use vast amount of
 missing and external data, as new sources of this data continue to emerge. But it can be difficult to determine exactly which data will provide the most value.
■  Privacy Concerns. To fully make use of available data, companies need
 to ensure they have proper consent, following both privacy regulations and respecting consumer boundaries.
■  Poor Data Sharing Processes. Some companies make the process of sharing data
 overly laborious and time-consuming. For example, some banks, even in developed nations, require digital data to be printed out, scanned and re-entered, which makes it difficult for employees to use the data in a timely way.
■  Lack of Direction from the Top. Accessing abundant data resources depends
 on an over-arching perspective that can only be shaped through top-down direction. Too often, this direction is missing, which reduces cross-functional collaboration and creates data fiefdoms.
The technology management hurdle relates to cost optimization. While the hyperbolic growth of data represents a great opportunity for companies to gain new insights, the abundance of data also imposes a heavy burden on computation, storage, and communication
 in data centers. Task assignment, data placement and data movement further influence the operational expenditure for business. It is therefore important for leaders to be aware of this tension-and to identify means for optimizing the benefits while making
 the best use of resources to minimize costs.
These barriers are not insurmountable. But to overcome them, company leaders must mandate that data be transparent and shared across the organization.
Leaders today need to make the Age of Abundance a clarion call. Those who do will take an important first step to helping their organization liberate data from its silos and unleash their workforce to gain crucial new insights without being overly reliant
 on experts.

"
67,"
In an era we call Business 4.0, digital technologies offer enterprises huge opportunities to create superior customer experiences, leverage ecosystems and embrace risk. It's no surprise then that digital transformation projects have
 become top-of-mind for executives at large organizations.
Yet there is a raft of smaller-but just as important-corporate improvement initiatives that have become stalled or are being ignored. Companies shouldn't ignore them, in part because they can free up investments for critical digital initiatives.
The problems that these improvement programs address most likely will sound familiar because most big companies have them: daily perational headaches that are degrading and slowing operations, costing customer goodwill and needlessly inflating internal spending.
 What's more, these bottlenecks can stand in the way of executing the strategies that C-level leaders and board members are prioritizing in the era of digital disruption.
Nearly every large company today can make operational improvements that will have a sizable impact strategically and on their top and bottom lines. These issues, affecting large and recurring costs, can be found throughout most organizations in such areas
 as accounts receivable, procurement, order activation, product enhancement, the supply chain, and the IT function.
Surgical improvements in these relatively neglected areas can yield major benefits. Even better, when key leaders share the same goals and coordinate the resources required for these efforts, they can make these operational tweaks quickly thanks to new automation
 tools. In turn, that allows and encourages the organization to re-focus on the larger digital transformations it must make.
An Investment with Outsized Returns


No company decides to build operational inefficiencies into its business processes; they accumulate over time thanks to choices made about technologies, investments, market strategies, and business unit wants and needs. These choices-often made as urgent
 problems arise, rarely made holistically with a view to the future health of the entire organization-start to add up, ultimately resulting in increases in ongoing overhead. Worse, they tend to thwart the flow of data and intelligence throughout the enterprise,
 affecting not simply operational efficiencies but, ultimately, the quality of the customer experience delivered, upon which the health of the organization depends.
The areas in which these operational issues exist-say, accounts receivable-may generate great volumes of data that could have significant value for the enterprise but, due to a variety of factors-perhaps disconnected systems, or political struggles over
 data ownership issues-the data are often unavailable outside of departmental or functional silos, limiting their usefulness to the enterprise.
A few years ago, addressing such a disconnect and gaining access to siloed data would require implementing a new system at a great cost of time and money. Today, fortunately, there are new technologies that can solve the problem far more quickly and inexpensively.
 Enterprise leaders can take advantage of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities both to discover where operational inefficiencies exist and, also, to turn them around. In many cases, this does not require a huge overhaul of business operations.
 Companies can often fine-tune their business processes and-thanks to automation-start seeing benefits in short order. These efforts may not have the cachet of digital transformation initiatives, but some companies have uncovered significant opportunities to
 generate more cash and sharply reduce costs on par with more disruptive transformation programs that require millions of dollars to launch and execute a much longer timeline for retrieving returns.
Where the Improvements Lie


Some examples of organizations retrieving a large return on investment via incremental operational improvements include:
  A telecom was able to dramatically reduce the time it took to get its new customers up and running, transforming not only the speed and cost of order fulfillment but thereby its customer's experience. In 2015, the company had a Net Promoter Score of minus
 44-not surprising given its largely manual order fulfillment processes at the time. In 2017, the situation quickly went from bad to worse when the local government mandated high-speed Internet access to every home and business by 2020. The deluge of service
 requests quickly became unmanageable with the average time to activate service stretching to an unforgivable 44 days from moment of customer inquiry.
After analyzing the order fulfillment process, the company found that reasons for the huge order fulfillment lag times were disintegrated systems and siloed operations. In response, it redesigned its order-toactivate- service process to create one case manager
 for each order. The case manager operated as a single point of customer contact, with sole accountability for the order. At the same time, the company consolidated ten different applications that were required to onboard a new customer into a single order
 intelligence platform. By 2018, cycle time for order activation had been cut in half. The cost to activate a new service dropped 60% and the company's Net Promoter Score more than doubled to a positive 20. All told, the company estimates that the effort will
 cut costs by approximately $70 million over three years.


  Taking a closer look at accounts receivable processes can also improve cash flow for many organizations. One $1.5 billion steel manufacturer, for example, was facing declining demand. Many of its 6,000 customers were delaying payment. Meanwhile, the company
 was struggling to correctly register the payments of those customers whose accounts were current, leading to disputes and increased overhead. To accelerate cash flow, the company developed an automated cash forecasting system, which could analyze data from
 finance, accounting, and other departments. The new system reduced disputes and increased collections by 28%.
Similarly, a utility company improved cash flow by $100 million and bad debt by $4 million by implementing an algorithm that identified unbilled accounts, which the company was able to cut in half.


  In procurement, identifying internal purchases that are non-compliant with corporate purchasing agreements can turn up overlooked savings possibilities or uncover fraud. Inefficient purchasing often arises in global manufacturers when multiple factories
 purchasing products from the same suppliers fail to communicate to pool their purchases to take advantage of volume discounts. Today, an increasing number of these companies are using software with artificial intelligence to scan purchase requests across multiple
 plants and vendors to better understand the behavior that drives purchasing price variances across plants. By doing so, they can see how much prices vary, receive notifications of exceptions to purchasing agreements, and flag purchase orders that look abnormal
 or indicate potential fraudulent activity.
One major oil company used such a system to flag 98,000 transactions in six months, achieving $3.2 million in annual expense reductions. Another firm, a global aluminum manufacturer, discovered $650,000 in potential savings after reviewing 100,000 purchasing
 transactions with its suppliers.
Similarly, a major airline identified $8 million a year in non-compliant travel and expense purchases, accounting for six percent of the airline's total T&E spend.
The same principle of incremental improvement applies to other operational areas. For example, by better tracking assets, companies can uncover and prevent inventory shrinkage from lost and stolen goods. The IT organization also can benefit from operational
 improvements. One pharmaceutical firm used artificial intelligence to make its data center operations more efficient. A banking investment firm employed AI software to reduce the time it took to resolve technology incidents by 90%.
Tweaks in marketing and sales processes can boost product innovation and generate new sources of revenue. A large software company performed advanced analytics on its customer data to identify which customers were most likely to buy its products. As a result,
 the company dramatically improved the targeting of its marketing campaigns. It also analyzed data on how customers were using its products and determined which features were critical and which were not. That analysis guided its product development teams in
 designing new features and new products.
Where to Begin


Identifying and implementing incremental improvements requires careful planning. By taking the following four steps, an organization can execute projects that optimize its return on investment.


1. Find the important value chain(s) with high impacts on operating costs, especially those that affect the customer experience. Important value chains vary by industry. For a telecom company, the customer acquisition process is foremost. For a gas
 or electrical utility, the most important value chain could be the ""meter to cash"" process, which includes billing and accounts receivable.


2. Identify key success metrics that (when achieved) will dramatically improve the organization's performance. The metrics may be about the bottom line or customer satisfaction. For utilities, important metrics to track include the cost to serve each
 customer and the percentage of consumers using self-service portals. When analyzing metrics results, companies must benchmark them against peers in the industry or organizations recognized as best-in-class across industries.


3. Identify which business processes impact the key measures and map out how they work end to end. Using a tool like Value Stream Mapping (VSM), a lean management technique that documents the entire value chain end to end, reveals both strengths and
 weaknesses in a given process. The VSM exercise clearly shows the ""hidden factories"" in a business process-i.e., process steps where inefficiencies have accumulated over years. It also shows how relevant data flows through the process, and identifies bottlenecks
 that result in customer dissatisfaction.


4. Establish a cross-functional team whose members can evaluate where and how to improve key business processes that will enhance customer experience and/or improve operational efficiencies. This involves mapping the transactional data generated by
 a business process. This data will be vital to analyzing the performance of that process.
Consider a telecom company that collects demographic data on customers in the sign-up process. The company can use that data to sharpen its customer profiling and better target its marketing campaigns to cross-sell and upsell customers for new services.
 It can also track customer profiles over time, collecting and analyzing data to predict churn.
The team also must assess which technology solutions to implement. Because there is a plethora of relatively low-cost, commercial off-theshelf software available, the team must carefully evaluate them on their expected benefits, how long they will take to
 implement and their cost.
For example, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a cost-effective solution to automate repetitive manual tasks in the back offices (such reading data from a PDF file and entering it into a system) and freeing up human talent to do more value-added activities.
 While these solutions do deliver efficiencies, make transactions error-free and can be easy to configure, they are not suitable in companies that process many transactions and make frequent process changes. The team's members, including both stakeholders and
 subject matter experts, are crucial to selecting the right set of technologies (whether RPA, analytics or AI) that can provide sustainable results for the best ROI.
Successful companies typically constitute a Center of Excellence (CoE) function headed by a senior leader (often a C-level executive) responsible for approving these operational improvement projects and monitoring their execution. The CoE provides resources,
 removes bottlenecks, helps coordinate organizational silos to ensure that the projects meet the deadline and delivers promised benefits.
A Near-Term Imperative
Companies that want to leverage these opportunities must create alignment and consensus among C-level leaders about operational improvement priorities and resource allocation. They also need to have executive buy-in for increased data sharing and operational
 automation, and identify and prepare key data required for process improvement an automation. What's more, they must carefully evaluate robotic process automation tools and AI capabilities that can automate manual processes and improve efficiency, cut costs,
 and reduce errors. Finally, they should use big data and analytics software to identify areas of rising costs or decreasing efficiencies.
Sweeping digital transformation may remain the top priority for most large organizations over the long term. However, surgical operational improvements can deliver significant savings and revenue opportunities in the near term.



"
68,"Around the world, companies are embarking on costly but crucial digital transformations. Their goal is to leverage new and still-emerging technologies to provide a truly differentiated customer experience that will attract new customers,
 retain old ones and drive revenue. Those that have had enterprise systems for years in order fulfillment and finance (ERP), manufacturing and logistics (supply chain management systems), customer-relationship management (marketing, sales and service), human
 resource management and other cross-functional processes have a big leg up in digital transformation. They already possess the crucial enterprise applications upon which new digital systems such as wireless sensors embedded in products (IoT), AI and analytics
 tools, and other technologies must be built.
Therefore, enterprise systems are not going away; if anything, they are becoming more important to digitizing a business. Yet many businesses with enterprise systems face a decision: whether keep the multimilliondollar enterprise
 systems they installed in their data centers a while ago (the so-called ""on-premises"" versions), or whether to update to the latest cloud-based versions of them, at a considerable expense.
In our view, the answer to that question is simple. It will largely depend on whether they will need the capabilities that the cloud-based versions of their enterprise systems uniquely offer, or not. Companies that won't need those
 capabilities for the foreseeable future, we argue, should continue to run and maintain their on-premises enterprise applications. However, those that will need those capabilities should seriously consider when they will need to shift to the cloud versions.
Most Companies Today are Sticking with On-Premises Enterprise Systems

The numbers reported by enterprise system companies like SAP and Oracle show that revenue from their cloud subscriptions is growing fast but is still much lower than traditional license revenue from on-premises software. For example, SAP said cloud revenue
 was 19% of total revenue (cloud plus software license and support) in 2017.1 However, that is changing. In July, SAP told stock analysts that cloud's share of its new business contract value was nearly 60%.2
With that data in mind and our client experience, we expect many companies to continue running the on-premises versions of enterprise systems from Oracle, Microsoft, SAP and other companies for the foreseeable future. (Salesforce.com's CRM system has been
 a cloud-based enterprise application from the start.)
Yet we expect other companies to switch to the cloud-based versions of their enterprise systems over the next few years for two primary reasons:
■  Only cloud-based versions of enterprise systems will offer business capabilities that are possible because of the unfettered on-demand computing power that cloud data centers can offer. Cloud-based enterprise software computing power can expand or shrink
 as needs change to provide the breakthrough digital customer experiences.
■  Major vendors of enterprise systems-such as Microsoft, SAP and Oracle-are themselves switching their focus to their cloud products and will, sooner rather than later, cease supporting their on-premises systems while encouraging their clients to switch
 to the cloud by offering tempting benefits such as lower prices, security enhancements and software updates with new features.
Even if the enterprise system vendors stop supporting the on-premises versions of their software, other organizations will be there to provide support. So we believe the first reason is the far more important one: That cloud-based enterprise systems will
 enable companies that periodically (or more often than that) need huge amounts of computing power to provide some digital product or digital experience. The story of Netflix's switch to the cloud more than 10 years ago is a great case in point.
The Instructive Story of Netflix

Cloud-based applications can be truly transformative, as Netflix, one of the early adopters of large-scale cloud computing, discovered more than a decade ago. Launched in 1998, Netflix started out with a mail-order business model,
 selling and renting out DVDs. But in 2007, it started a new online streaming service, offering customers about 1,000 movies-only 1% of its catalogue. To enable that, it invested $40 million to build out its data centers and pay for the license fees to stream
 movies to early-adopter customers.3And that was for 1% of its catalogue!
It did not take Netflix's executives long to realize that they would not have enough money (or data processing expertise) to stream the remaining 99% of its movies to its growing customer base. Accordingly, in 2008 Netflix turned
 to Amazon Web Services' cloud computing platforms. This allowed Netflix to offer customers a vastly improved experience as they could gain immediate access to their favorite movies rather than wait for snail mail to deliver a DVD and then be bothered with
 mailing it back.
The rest is history. By 2017, Netflix had 117 million subscribers to its streaming service, which generated more than 90% of its $11.7 billion in annual revenue. As Netflix grew, adding new customers and keeping old ones, the company
 has evolved into a media services provider, moving into the content-generation business. By 2017, it had created $6 billion worth of original content.4
Today, Netflix no longer owns a single data center. Yet by 2015, 37% of all peak internet download traffic in North America came from Netflix's streaming service.5


The Capabilities Cloud-Based Enterprise Applications Will Offer

Companies are starting to benefit from a range of new technologies in cloud-based enterprise applications software-capabilities that are creating a revolution in the digital customer experience. Three advancements are particularly important:

■  Advances in data analytics technologies are making it possible for companies to better detect and respond to customer trends. Forrester Research has identified more than 50 so-called ""insights-driven businesses""-including not only Netflix but also
 Amazon, Facebook, Google, Tesla, AOL and GE. In 2015, they generated cumulative revenues of around $300 billion, and this figure is expected to grow to $1.8 trillion by 2021.6 According to Ted Schadler, a Forrester Research vice president and principal analyst,
 ""These companies harness and apply data at every opportunity to differentiate their products and customer experiences."" And for those companies that are resisting the switch to cloud, he has this warning: ""That makes them faster and fleeter than you.""7

■  The rapid adoption of agile product development approaches means (among other things) that customer feedback can be fed directly into the product development cycle. That allows companies to alter course and respond quickly
 to changing customer desires and needs, as well as market conditions.

■  The evolution of automation capabilities, which allow companies to experiment cost-effectively and test many product ideas at the same time, to bring products to market faster than ever.

To seize these opportunities, many companies will need computing power and real-time response capabilities in the cloud-based versions of their enterprise applications.
Many companies are beginning to realize this. For example, earlier this decade, KLM, the Netherlands' flagship airline, found it could improve customer service through its interactions with customers through social media. In 2010, when an Icelandic volcano
 erupted that year, KLM was overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of posts from its 24 million followers on social media channels.8 Passengers were providing the airline with important feedback, but it was finding it difficult to respond in a timely
 way. Contact center agents struggled to deal with associated calls from customers. To address the problem, KLM used Salesforce's CRM cloud service-which included Facebook and Twitter private message functionality-and ""Digital Genius""artificial intelligence
 capability, which provided intelligent chatbots for rapid customer service responses. Very quickly, the airline saw an uptick in customer satisfaction, with a significant reduction in call center handling times.9
Another way cloud-based enterprise applications can transform the customer experience is by allowing companies to receive, process and distribute huge numbers of digital files simultaneously. As part of its routine customer interactions, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles
 must issue warranty and recall notices. It is a complex undertaking, and the automotive giant elected to use Salesforce's cloud-based software to institute automated recalls. The technological solution led to an improved customer experience across the board
 as response times were better and service agents were freed up to spend more time on other customerfacing activities.
Two Key Steps to Migrating to Cloud-Based Enterprise Applications

Again, moving to cloud-based versions of an enterprise system will not be mandatory for many companies in the next few years. But for those that want to shift to the cloud versions, we suggest they follow a twostage
 process:

1. The Strategic Review
Corporate leaders should audit their company's existing business requirements, processes and enterprise applications, then calculate the impact of migrating those applications to the cloud, taking into account upfront costs, the implications for business
 processes, and the likely improvements in performance and security.
This lays the foundation for creating a business case for cloud migration aligned with the company's overall business strategy. This should includeinformation about the competitive landscape and prevalent market trends for enterprise
 applications (in particular) and technology (in general). As part of this process, they should look for opportunities to simplify the company's IT infrastructure.

2. The Implementation Plan 
Once the strategic review has been conducted, a clear implementation plan is essential. After addressing critical data issues-such as security and privacy, the amount and type of data to be migrated, and data cleansing requirements-leaders
 should create a series of work streams to ensure a seamless migration from on-premise to cloud-based enterprise systems.
Companies must address the context of the initiative, covering the quality of the user experience, the alignment of business processes with the firm's goals and objectives, and change management challenges (including the creation
 of an internal communications strategy as roles and jobs will be transformed along with technology).
All work streams should focus on the core components of a successful migration from on-premises to cloud-based enterprise applications. For instance, there should be one process for data migration that covers not only all the different
 types of data (from basic user login details to sophisticated transaction data) that will be loaded onto cloud-based enterprise applications but also the digital tools required to extract the data from the legacy on-premises systems.
Another work stream should cover the integration of all the cloud-based enterprise applications-for example, how CRM sales and customer service applications will be integrated with HR, supply chain management, financials, data warehouse
 and external data feeds.
Two separate work streams should cover mobile devices and social media. It will be important that the new cloud-based enterprise applications can be accessed on mobile devices, which is how customers and employees increasingly expect
 to use them. Social media must be leveraged for generating sales leads and capturing customer feedback on products and services.
Other work streams should cover key performance indicators (and how the information should be presented on dashboards), dedicated portals for customers and employees, and global requirements (and the extent to which the selected cloud-based
 system can take a ""follow the sun"" approach by catering to local needs around the world).
With so many work streams, migrating on-premises enterprise applications to their cloud versions can be immensely complex. As a result, we recommend two other work streams that address some very practical implementation issues: user
 adoption and testing. The user adoption work stream should draw up the detailed programs for training those employees who will be key users of the cloud-based enterprise applications. The testing work stream should devise stress tests for the whole enterprise
 system and build in time for fixes and retesting to confirm quality.
If the new cloud-based enterprise system passes tough stress tests, it will be ready to be rolled out across the company. Yet another work stream should take charge of drawing up a series of go-live plans based on business needs.
 Ideally, the plans should be rolled out in phases, possibly starting with a pilot run. In such a complex environment, problems will arise, and a phased roll-out will give corporate leaders, working with their cloud provider partners, the chance to address
 and overcome them.
Migration Stories: How Two Companies Moved to Cloud-Based Enterprise Applications

Consider the case of a Japan-based global cash solutions company that had made multiple acquisitions over several years and developed numerous lines of business in more than 25 countries. In 2015, it was faced with a chaotic set of
 legacy enterprise systems that were degrading operational efficiency and preventing it from growing effectively.
To solve the problem, the company decided to launch a digital transformation with the aim of creating a fully digitized and integratedoperation using Oracle's cloud-based applications. It then carried out a phased-in, three-step approach
 to migrating from on-premises applications to Oracle hybrid cloud applications. This strategy reduced operational and other risks. In addition, it enabled the company to learn from any difficulties that arose while demonstrating both real and potential returns
 on investment.
The first step, set up to reap early business benefits through quick wins while ensuring business continuity, was implementing customerfacing customer experience components: service, customer relationship management, marketing and
 configure-price-quote (CPQ). These were chosen for their relative ease of implementation and because if the implementation went sideways, it would have a relatively trivial impact on the overall business.
The second major step the financial services firm took was migrating core business functions such as manufacturing, finance and the supply chain operation. This step involved integrating different types of applications: software as
 a service, infrastructure as a service, and on-premises applications. The company selected a ""pilot site"" for implementing the standard global Oracle cloud solution, which mitigated the risk to its global business.
The third step-implementing additional components such as financial planning and budgeting, compliance and executive reporting - provided data integrity and a ""single source of the truth"" for improved corporate governance, transparency
 and traceability within the company's consolidated reporting platform.
The strategic three-step approach proved a success, yielding significant reductions in the legacy IT costs as well as in the customer's purchase and sales order cycle-times. The financial services company is now implementing multiple
 planned rollouts of its digital transformation across 23 countries.
Similarly, a British engineering firm employing 25,000 people had amassed many disjointed HR systems with ineffective controls and reporting. As a result, the HR team had little visibility into staffing levels, and this was leading
 to poor operational efficiency and an underwhelming customer experience.
To tackle the problem, the firm integrated its HR operations with the business suite offered by SuccessFactors, which provides cloud-based human capital management software solutions. As a first step, it set up a steering committee
 to provide strong governance and oversight of the implementation program. Then, the new cloud-based HR system was deployed in a series of modules (including an employee portal, training, recruitment management, recruitment marketing and on-boarding) and then
 trained key users who, in turn, were tasked with training their fellow workers.
The results have been substantial. The engineering firm now has what it calls ""one version of the truth"" when it comes to HR management. And there have been several other benefits: a seamless flow of data for the recruitment process,
 the capacity to adopt best practices, reduced costs from a cloud applications subscription model, and improved employee engagement.
It's Decision Time for Companies That Must Shift to Cloud-Based Enterprise Systems
Enterprise systems, operating on-premises or delivered from the cloud, are a foundation for digital transformation. For companies that soon will need the cloud capabilities of an enterprise system, the time has come to decide when
 and how to move to the cloud.
Those that already determined they needed the immense on-demand computing power of cloud-based enterprise systems are reaping the benefits.

"
69,"
Customer support has become a key differentiator in almost every industry. It's especially important for companies that provide costly, complex, and critical equipment and other products, from industrial manufacturers of power equipment,
 heavy vehicles, HVAC systems, and medical devices to makers of home computers, appliances, and cars.
Competition in these sectors has intensified-not simply on the basis of who has the better product but which company can provide the best experience after customer's purchase. Indeed, as many products and services have become commoditized,
 customer support can be the only factor that sets a company apart s. In a recent Salesforce.com survey of customer service leaders in nearly 300 manufacturing companies, 86% said the customer experience they provided was a key differentiator.1
Investing in ongoing customer support is no longer an option, in large part because it's easier than ever for dissatisfied customers to find another source. Seven out of 10 consumers and 82% of business buyers said technology makes
 it easy to find alternatives for their purchases if they are unhappy with customer service, according to the Salesforce.com report. What's more, 78% of business buyers said they would likely switch to another brand if their experience with a manufacturer was
 inconsistent across that manufacturer's departments.
However, providing highly effective customer support is difficult to do and can raise a manufacturer's costs significantly. As a result, both B2B and B2C manufacturers have been increasing their investment in post-sales customer support.
 Those companies who rated their service performance as excellent in the Salesforce.com survey were 1.6 times more likely to have increased their service budgets over the previous two years than the underperformers. And they were 1.8 times more likely to plan
 to increase their budget over the following two years.
Adding the contact centers, customer service staff, field repair forces, and other resources required to provide high-quality service is not always cost effective. The mounting costs of long-term customer support is quickly becoming
 economically untenable for many companies. The automotive industry is a prime example of an industry of the mounting costs of customer service-in this case, the cost of managing product recalls. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, more than 50 million vehicles were recalled
 annually in the U.S.-more than twice the recall rate two decades earlier-likely a result of the increase in electronic parts and software in vehicles. As a result, U.S.-based automakers and their suppliers paid $11.8 billion in claims in 2016 for defective
 products, according to AlixPartners.2
There is a way forward, though, that can make it possible for companies to provide significantly better customer support at dramatically lower costs. They can take advantage of rapidly advancing intelligent automation systems-a combination
 of sensors, cognitive capabilities, and robotics - to transform customer support. But doing so requires vision and leadership. Customer service and technology leaders, along with their executive committees and business unit leaders, must relinquish their traditional
 notions of customer support and reimagine those processes for the digital age.
Those that seize the opportunity to incorporate intelligent automation into their customer support operations can not only cut their support costs, they can provide proactive and even predictive customer service, boost loyalty and
 revenues, and gather intelligence to improve future product designs.
The Big Picture

Some companies have begun to invest in the automation technologies that could reduce the cost and improve the nature of post-sale customer service, but the majority have only scratched the surface of the transformation these tools
 could enable.
Many have begun with the most obvious application of cognitive capabilities-complementing or replacing contact center labor. In 2006, there were no web chat offerings, smart phone apps, or social media interactions for customer service.
 Email was rarely used for customer issues. By 2013, digital interactions such as email, web chat, social media, texts and instant messaging accounted for 35 percent of customer interactions.3

Just 2% of customer service and support operations have integrated their virtual customer assistant or chatbot technology across their engagement channels--a proportion set to rise to 25% by 2020.4 While implementing software that
 sounds like a human customer support agent is an interesting application, it doesn't go far enough to differentiate a company's customer support function. In fact, it may not even be the highest-value use case for automation. Companies may see greater returns
 but keeping their human customer service force in place and applying their automation investments in other areas that offer more significant improvements in customer care and costs, such as deploying automated systems that can make human agents more effective.

As Siemens, GE, Tetra Pak, HP, Otis Elevator, Cargill, Medivators and other companies are finding, those that use intelligent automation technology in customer support are fundamentally rethinking what customer support could become
 in an era of powerful automation technologies.
They realize that automation technologies provide them and their customers with customer support capabilities that weren't technically or economically possible in the past.
How Intelligent Automation Transforms Customer Support

The new customer support capabilities that intelligent automation technologies make possible can be organized into six categories:


1. Preventing product breakdowns from happening in the first place. Predictive maintenance is one of the killer applications of intelligent automation. Companies can monitor products for signs of potential failure and address
 the problem before it happens. Spending on predictive maintenance applications, enabled by Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, is on the rise. IoT Analytics predicts such spending will grow 39% annually, from $2.2 billion in 2017 to $10.9 billion by 2022.5
 Salesforce.com found 54% of manufacturers were using IoT in customer service and more than 70% of them were already using the technology to diagnose products, how customers are using them, and identify product and component failures.6
Otis Elevator, which has been remotely monitoring its products for more than 30 years, launched an IoT-enabled service called Otis ONE this May. Smart sensors gather information from more than 300,000 elevators and escalators in service,
 sending that data to the cloud for analysis. The system alerts building owners and the firm's 33,000 service technicians of elevators and escalators that are likely to break down.7 Through a two-way video connection, the new service also notifies
 passengers in malfunctioning elevators that help is on the way.8
Schneider Electric SE is outfitting its oil pumps with IoT to predict mechanical problems in remote locations for its oil field drilling customers.9 Schneider Electric gathers that information in the cloud, where machine-learning
 applications detect patterns in rod pump mechanisms that point to impending failures. The technology can also change the way a pump operates to avoid shutdowns and notify the customer that a repair must be done.10


2. Fixing problems remotely. In some cases, companies can take intelligent maintenance a step further, automatically fixing products remotely or after a customer notifies them of a problem. Software vendors have been able to
 provide remote fixes for years, and the mobile app industry has since followed suit. Such capabilities are now spreading to other industries.
The newest models from car manufacturers like Cadillac and Ford can receive ""over the air"" updates to the software they have on board. These updates could save automakers billions of dollars a year, according to one industry analyst.11
 In 2012, electric car maker Tesla enabled its car owners to download software to fix problematic keyless entry systems and add new features such as automatic lane changing and windshield wipers that adjust their speed based on the amount of rain.12
Minneapolis-based medical device maker Medivators recently implemented a new field service system from GE and software company PTC to enable remote diagnostics and service. More than three-quarter of the company's service calls are
 now resolved from afar.13 

3. Elevating contact center and field repair capabilities. Intelligent automation can complement the capabilities of human contact center agents and field repair personnel with automated advisers that walk them through the
 best solutions to customers' problems. Some companies have reduced the costs of responding to customer inquiries by as much as 70% and boosted customer satisfaction by implementing virtual customer assistants, according to Gartner.14
Siemens uses intelligent automation to repair its recently unveiled eHighway, an electric road freight transport system that reduces pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions on heavily used truck routes. Technicians servicing the trucks
 can provide service with their hands free of manuals, using Microsoft's HoloLens to view a service checklist and repair diagrams, and remotely consult with experts at headquarters.15
Likewise, Tetra Pak, a manufacturer of food processing and packaging machines and systems, also delivers work instructions via mobile app and augmented reality. Its service technicians carry smartphones loaded with apps to tap into
 service manuals, checklists, problemsolving methodologies and a global issue database. Technicians or machine operators who need help with a machine can don augmented reality goggles that let remote Tetra Pak specialists view problems live and from the field,
 and offer step-by-step advice to repair equipment.16

4. Enabling customers to solve problems. Using remote diagnosis, AI, and other technologies, companies can provide advice and tools to customers so they can solve product problems themselves.
HP has been using automated technologies to help customers fix their HP computers and printers. In 2017, HP handled more than 600 million requests for technical support. It developed a virtual intelligent agent that engages customers
 in a conversation and helps them diagnose and solve problems, identifying the most pertinent information from HP's 50,000 pages of product information. If HP's virtual agent can't fix the issue, the customer is transferred to a customer support agent, who
 has all the information that the virtual agent has collected on the issue, including remote diagnostic results, the customer's system state, and its serial number.17

5. Eliminating recurring product issues. Intelligent automation can also help companies pinpoint continual problems with current products in the field and fix product design flaws in future updates or product generations.
This is a newer application of IoT and AI, but one likely to provide significant value in the near future. ""There aren't a lot of line engineers adopting IoT to make products better,"" says Bryan Kester, director of IoT for product
 design software and engineering company Autodesk. But he expects that to change quickly once product designers and engineers see the benefit of product performance data and analytics in their work. ""We're finally at a point where design engineers seem to have
 valid reasons for experimenting with IoT,"" he says.18
Sensor analytics solution provider KONUX's cloud-based AI system continuously learns from the sensor alerts it receives to continually improve the overall performance of the system and give recommendations for extending asset life
 cycles.19
Companies could even take this to the point of products that make themselves better. ""You can start to figure out those [product design problems] quickly and understand the sources of error and failure on a fleet of manufacturing
 assets,"" says Chris Larkin, GE vice president of products, analytics, and machine learning. ""We believe the intelligent asset of the future is self-healing and self-adjusting.""20

6. Helping customers use products more effectively. Intelligent automation can be applied not just to fix product problems, but also help customers get greater value from those products. Sensors can monitor how customers are
 using a product and provide automated advice about how to improve what they're doing with it.
Agribusiness giant Cargill has partnered with Consumer Physics to develop a spectrometer to help dairy farmers analyze the forage their cows eat. By making the device small enough to fit in a farmer's pocket and connecting it to a
 smartphone application and the cloud, this IoTenabled system analyzes the cows' diet at the site, enabling farmers to do make better nutritional choices for their cows right there and then.21
In 2016, fitness wearable maker Fitbit collaborated with Northwestern Medicine and the University of California San Francisco to study the impact of physical activity of patients who underwent spinal surgery. In this case, the ""product""
 being monitored is the patient's back. The researchers can track patients' physical activity four weeks before surgery and six months afterwards, not simply to predict which ones are at risk of being readmitted to the hospital but also to suggest ongoing physical
 regiments to reduce that possibility.22

Employing Intelligent Automation in Your CX Transformation
To reap these significant and wide-ranging benefits, companies must move beyond the short-sighted view that the sole value of AI and other automation technologies is in replacing customer support personnel. The technologies may indeed
 reduce the human workload over time, but that's not the right starting point for transforming post-sales customer support.
Instead, companies should start by first determining how they might use intelligent automation within the product they manufacture, while they're in customer's possession, or to reduce the need for customer support altogether. They
 should also think about how to combine and leverage product usage, maintenance, and customer inquiry information with other data and to improve the customer experience over the product lifecycle.
They should also explore integrating data from their CRM systems to get a deeper understanding of the types of support and product problems that are occurring, the supply chain system to identify where flawed products are in the system,
 and product lifecycle management systems to correct design flaws that are showing up in the field.
The following actions can help companies use intelligent automation to lower costs and improve the quality of post-sales customer support:
■  Explore which service improvements would have the most value for customers-and which they might actually pay for.
■  Determine which processes to automate to deliver that value, including the data collection and analysis required to understand changing customer behavior. (Design thinking can be used to simulate, test, and refine new customer service options).
■  Select the appropriate intelligent automation technologies for those high-value use cases.
■  Making the financial case for the intelligent automation investment, calculating the initial and ongoing automation costs against the customer revenue, loyalty and other improvements.
■  Begin with one pilot project and gather intelligence on what works and what doesn't to enable broader applications.
■  Invest in IT systems that can support the experimental design and testing approach required for iterative transformation: a combination of agile, DevOps, and provisioning automation.
■  Study emerging trends in how customers are reacting to automation technologies (such as voice-activated assistants), add the most valuable ones to the intelligent customer support platform.
A Cost-Effective Means to Provide Long-Term Customer Care
As the commoditization of products and services across B2B and B2C industries increases, customer experience has become the key differentiator for manufacturers-not just leading up to a sale, but in the area of long-term customer
 support. Intelligent automation offers a way forward for leading companies to elevate that experience in six significant ways, while controlling the costs required to do so.

"
70,"Accustomed to seamless interactions and personalized consumer experiences on their smartphones, customers now are looking for the same in their business experiences. To meet this rising expectation, companies are redesigning the user
 experience (UX) by implementing smart technologies and design thinking focused on the end user to mimic human interactions. Here are just four examples:
1. Smart user interfaces that allow customers to personalize their experience according to their preferences, giving them control of the interactions.
2. Chatbots that can understand voice or text and reply in a human manner.
3. Voice agents that sound human, responding and taking actions in contextually appropriate ways to customer queries.
4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology (such as email assistants) that can schedule meetings with other AI-based assistants without requiring humans to go back-and-forth to align each other's schedules.
These advanced design solutions are good for business. A 2015 study by the Design Management Institute found the stock prices of design-led companies outperformed the S&P index by 211% over the previous 10 years.1 And a
 recent Forrester study found half of design-led businesses believe advanced design practices boost customer satisfaction and loyalty.2
Many companies are adopting agile business practices, automation and AI. However, those wishing to distinguish themselves need to deliver superior, personalized, multichannel customer experiences (CX). To do that, companies must master
 a blend of design processes with cuttingedge technological skills.

Getting it Wrong - A Bad Mix of the Outdated with the Avant-Garde
Designing experiences for customers begins by understanding their behaviors and preferences, and that means taking advantage of advanced analytics tools. Without fact-based insights into what customers want, companies will miss the
 mark in trying to create a superior CX.
On the one hand, some CX designers are trapped in the past, their designs limited by what was possible 10 or 15 years ago, not what can be done today with new technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality or chatbots with
 natural language processing capabilities. As a result, these designers produce CXs that are like an early automobile equipped with rough-riding wooden wagon wheels.
On the flip side, there are designers so eager to deploy the latest technologies that they fail to consider whether they have business value. These designers want AI, augmented reality or chatbots in all their designs, but fail to
 consider the humans who will use them, and the businesses that must pay for them. For example, they might spend too much money and take too much time to deploy a chatbot to answer questions that could have been resolved through a basic frequently asked questions
 (FAQ) web page.
At both extremes, these CX designers are not practicing human-centered design thinking. Designers should begin with data at their fingertips and combine it with old-school user research and testing to develop a deeper understanding
 of customer needs and desires. Then they should pick appropriate technological solutions from the full toolbox of possibilities.

What Works: Designing Interactive CX Based on Deep Customer Knowledge
CX designers should never use technology for its own sake. Instead, they should only deploy technology to help customers accomplish tasks more efficiently, effectively, and effortlessly.
The best CX starts with a deep understanding of how a company's customers behave, what they perceive, and how they like to interact with the company and each other. CX design should seek to improve the customer’s journey-making it
 simpler, faster, more efficient, and more pleasurable-by enabling continuous innovation, offering better or entirely new journeys for their customers. Chatbots, AI, and other advanced technologies may play important roles, but only in the service of improving
 the CX, or reimagining the way companies sell to or serve their market and customers.
Some of the most successful design-led companies have found ways to use technologies to improve and reconceive their CX. For instance:
■ Instead of forcing users to hunt for information they need, Google Assistant proactively provides contextual notifications about flight status, traffic updates, product shipments and more, without being asked.
■ Netflix uses a complex algorithm to evaluate TV and movie content according to thousands of qualifiers, including elements of mood, aesthetic, and pace. The algorithm integrates with machine learning and AI to recommend programs that customers might not
 have found on their own. Customers clearly trust and appreciate these recommendations. Netflix says 80% of the content its viewers watch comes from these automated recommendations. They have been a big factor in the company's nearly tenfold revenue growth
 between 2007 and 2017 (from $1.2 billion to $11.7 billion).3
Designers must be able to empathize with the problems customers face. For example, most companies have far to go in designing their CX to be accessible and inclusive for people with special needs. Also, as the senior population grows, CX designers will need
 to tailor the UX to their needs - for example, letting them adjust font sizes or putting titles on all videos for customers with hearing loss.
Such inclusive CX design sends a welcoming, compassionate message to all customers and build long-term trust and loyalty.
Finally, for CX design innovations to be sustainable, they must add value to the business. Delighting the customer by orchestrating a smooth, intuitive journey must go hand-in-hand with improving revenue. Market leadership depends upon finding the right
 balance between CX investment and profitability.

How Design-Led Thinking Spurs Innovation
To design great customer experiences, designers must first gather insights on customer needs to determine which problems their designs should solve. Having gathered these insights, designers should work together to generate ideas,
 develop prototypes, and iteratively refine their best concepts.
Design-led thinking incorporates technology, but it starts with a focus on customers. For example, when Ford Motor’s Lincoln division set about redesigning its Continental luxury car for the Brazilian and Indian markets, it began
 by considering the needs of luxury car users in those countries. Because both Brazil and India have a significant air pollution problems, Lincoln made sure the car had good air seals. And because traffic in large Brazilian and Indian cities is typically snarled,
 business meetings often are held in cars. Accordingly, Lincoln equipped its cars for those markets with tray tables and other conveniences to make it easier to hold meetings inside the automobiles.4
Such companies complemented their data-driven designs with rapid prototyping. Using agile development methods, designers conducted tests, collected customer feedback, refined their ideas, and launched value-added products and services
 into the marketplace.
For example, when insurance and financial services company MassMutual realized its life insurance products were not appealing to consumers under 40, it worked with a global design partner to develop an educational, multichannel experience
 that would serve as a sort of ""master's program for adulthood."" To implement the program, MassMutual embraced new digital tools and new business processes. Committed to the principles of good CX, MassMutual designed the program to be flexible so that it can
 evolve as the company gleans new insights from participants.5

Service Design-Developing a Better Understanding of the Customer Journey
As digital ecosystems grow more complex, customer journeys and the systems needed to facilitate those journeys also become more complicated. A service design approach can help companies visualize, investigate and understand customer
 touchpoints and lifecycles even as they become more self-aware, comprehending the people, processes, systems, and organizational cultures that enable these experiences.
By examining the entire customer lifecycle - as well as their own capabilities - companies may discover places where and how their brands could do a better job meeting their customers' expectations and discovering other business areas
 ripe for innovation.

Rethinking the Customer Journey - Matching New Interactive Technologies to CX
Companies have a golden opportunity to deliver interactive experiences through emerging channels. However, trying to match new technologies with traditional user journeys is unlikely to succeed. Instead, companies should attempt to
 imagine creative use cases that disrupt existing journeys.
In designing these innovative processes and pathways that take full advantage of new technologies, companies should keep three guardrails in mind:
1. ROI - Define key metrics at the beginning of the design process. Then measure performance at milestones along the way to make sure projects deliver their intended benefits.
2. Agile engineering - Respond to feedback with an iterative improvement loop that fuels faster development and leads to continuous improvement in CX.
3. Lean user experience - As work progresses iteratively, look for ways to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization.

Designing Results - What to Expect from Successful CX/UX Transformations
By following these, companies can achieve five types of CX transformations:
1. Moving from taking orders to making recommendations. Any company can respond to demand and give customers the products they request. Design-led companies advance to the next level by suggesting products
 and services that customers are likely to enjoy and appreciate.

Companies that excel in this field (like Netflix and Amazon) collect and analyze large data sets to develop a deep understanding of the customers' latent wants and needs. Ultimately, the goal is to know one’s customers so well that a company can reliably anticipate
 what sorts of products or services will delight them.

2. Changing from solving problems to preventing them. Any company can react to problems that customers report; better ones solve problems before they occur.


Good CX designers constantly evaluate customer journeys to identify potential problems before they become major headaches. Companies can then nip them in the bud to keep customers happy and loyal.

3. Going from clueless to clued-in. Clueless companies do not have a finger on the customer pulse. Consequently, they are caught by surprise when customer dissatisfaction surfaces. Clued-in companies continuously monitor the
 effectiveness of their CX. They notice pain points early on and have full situational awareness of any problems customers may be having with a product or service. As a result, they can correct problems quickly and give customers a better experience with their
 products or services.

4. Shifting from lengthy response times to instant help. Years ago, many industries moved at a slower pace. In those days, customers might be willingly to wait several days (or longer) for solutions to their problems. Now customers
 expect problems to be resolved in hours or even minutes. Fortunately, technological advances can help companies keep pace.
For example, some financial advisory firms have begun using AI and neural networks to expedite answers to customer inquiries. One firm with which TCS has worked uses an automated system that manages, analyzes and responds to complex
 client emails. This system understands each email's content, interprets the customer's intent and emotion, then accurately responds with a set of suitable recommendations.6

5. Transitioning from simple to complex uses of automation. Plenty of companies use automated services to help customers with simple problems. This sort of automation might administer a phone tree or remind customers of their
 account balances.
That's child's play compared to the real prize of using AI and machine learning to build automated services that solve problems in ways that dramatically improve CX.
Design-led CX - Three Companies Improving Customer Journeys and Reaping Rewards
Across industries and geographies, companies have begun using design thinking to improve CX. Each of these examples show how design-led initiatives to improve CX can help enterprises solve major problems and achieve significant ROI:

Changing the weather for customers in Scotland
In Scotland, a large water utility faced supply interruptions, low pressure, contamination threats and customer fury each winter when low temperatures caused aging pipes to freeze and burst. The utility's call centers were overwhelmed with complaints. Its reputation
 suffered a serious blow, and regulators penalized the company with heavy fines. The utility could not change the weather, but it could change the way it handled customer complaints. It adopted flexible, omnichannel methods of taking customer complaints via
 email and through its website, as well as over the phone. This approach simultaneously lowered costs and reduced pressure on the call centers.

The new system the company implemented had the technological capability to automate service orders and dispatch repair crews. It also gave the utility the ability to update customers via text message on the progress of repairs, while using predictive analytics
 and personalization to customize each customer's experience. By using agile engineering methods and advanced technologies such as automation, the utility' designed a lean, frictionless CX. As a result, it saved £12 million and saw customer complaints drop
 80% in a single year.

Streamlining design for profit
Eaton Corp. PLC, the Ireland-based leader in power management and equipment sales, was making customers struggle through a complex purchase process. Even worse, the company incurred steep operating costs as it juggled more than 30 online storefronts and tried
 to cope with siloed product categories spread across the enterprise. Determined to resolve these issues, Eaton embarked on a design-led process to improve the way customers accessed and experienced its products, services, promotions and offers. There were
 three major components to the redesign: a global ecommerce strategy with streamlined processes built on a modern technological foundation; a unified online storefront and product catalog, and localized solution support for nine languages, six currencies and
 various local units of measurement.
These and numerous other changes have helped the company grow strongly in recent years. Annual revenue has risen nearly 50% since 2010, from $13.7 billion to $20 billion.7 Customers reported greater satisfaction with the
 purchase process. Eaton managed to create new cross-selling opportunities while simultaneously reducing its operating costs.

Enhancing engagement through integration and customization
The customers of U.S. health insurance company Humana had to deal with more than 60 separate websites. The $54 billion company (2017 revenue8) wanted to create an integrated, unified digital brand that would offer its users personalized, consistent
 CX across all channels.
Using a design-led approach, the company updated more than 5,000 webpages to offer a better UX. Its new Web presence featured rich media and responsive user engagement features. By gathering more than 150 components under a single
 digital platform, Humana gave customers a consistent, unified experience with the company. The new digital platform made it easier for Humana to engage with its customers through social channels. It also gave Humana the ability to customize and contextualize
 its communications strategy, making sure that customers receive the right promotions at the right time. These improvements to its digital CX helped Humana increase its customer base 18%.
The Best Time to Build Better Digital CX? Now.
Companies across multiple sectors around the world have discovered the value of using design-led thinking to give customers smoother, easier and more interactive experiences.
Advanced technologies like AI, natural language processing, smart chatbots and automation have advanced to the point where they can play a major role in meeting customer demands and wishes.
The caveat here is that these tools are only effective if they are deployed systematically and purposefully through a design-led process. Technology for its own sake can be an expensive distraction. Technology used in the service
 of meeting and exceeding customer expectations can be a game changer.
Of course, technology also has an important role to play in discovering these customer insights through the collection, analysis and reporting on big data sets. Using these insights, companies can then deploy agile, lean and iterative
 processes to find which technological solutions will have the biggest impact on CX and offer the greatest competitive advantage in customer attraction and retention.

"
71,"Blockchain technology, which came to prominence with the success of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has the potential to transform the way companies interact with their customers. Blockchain is a platform for decentralized computing that
 enables anyone to exchange value with another party without relying on a central authority to transact securely.1 This means individuals or organizations can conduct their activities without an intermediary.
Today, senior executives in nearly every economic sector are looking to harness blockchain's power to create new value for customers. For example, through the Food Trust blockchain group, Walmart is collaborating with major players in the food, consumer
 goods and retail industry - including Dole Foods, Kroger, Tyson Foods, and Unilever - to create a system designed to be ""the equivalent of FedEx tracking for food,"" says Frank Yiannas, Walmart vice president for food safety.2 Why do this? Because
 now it can take too long to trace contaminated food in the supply chain - for instance, between 18 hours and six days to trace a shipment of mango slices from a Mexican orchard to a Walmart store in Arkansas - using paper and existing IT systems that rely
 on barcode scanners.
In a demo, the blockchain system did it in 2.2 seconds.
Rather than having to wait days to address an outbreak of a food-borne illness or some other quality control issue that affects customers, Walmart could respond almost instantly, avoiding reputational damage and, more importantly, guarding the public's health.
As this example illustrates, blockchain can help companies become better at what they already do by reducing their costs (thereby delivering savings that can be passed on to the customer in the form of bettervalue products and services) and by reducing the
 sources of friction that can degrade the customer relationship. We think of this as a ""Curve 1"" blockchain opportunity, one that makes a marketplace of buyers, sellers and the parties in between them more efficient.
But blockchain's impact is likely to be far greater. At its most advanced,the technology can help companies transform the life experiences of their customers. They can do this by collaborating in decentralized networks that include other companies, individuals,
 governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to create more personalized ""life experiences"" - everything from birthday parties, ""green"" vacations, new homes and new jobs, to integrated healthcare and start-to-finish journeys involving planes, trains
 and automobiles. We think of this as a ""Curve 2"" opportunity that creates ""life experience"" ecosystems. The companies on this curve will use blockchain to interact with their customers in new ways.
To compete and succeed in the emerging blockchain landscape, companies need to ride both curves (see Figure 1 below). In general,as described by Ian Morrison, former President of the Institute for the Future, innovation along Curve 1 represents improvements
 to the status quo to optimize processes and make an organization more competitive.Curve 2 represents innovation around new models.3 At some point, a Curve 2 model will emerge to become mainstream, itself beginning the optimization path as the next
 Curve 1 in a continuous back-and-forth between innovation and maturity. Investing in blockchain along both curves helps prepare organizations for the crossover when Curve 2 innovation surpasses Curve 1, becoming the new norm.


Blockchain Now (Curve 1): Remove Friction and Frustration from the Customer Experience

Blockchain technology represents a valuable opportunity for creating efficiencies in existing ecosystems because it cuts out the need for an expensive and inefficient layer of intermediaries. The technology employs three key concepts to achieve this:
 ■  A
digital ledger links authenticated records of transactions - known as blocks - in a way that is transparent, trustworthy and verifiable, encrypted and decentralized. This means that participants in the blockchain all see the same changes to the shared
 record of events at the same time. No third-party entity needs to update the ledger or validate it. The changes are secured through encryption, and every block that updates the blockchain is authenticated before it is added to the shared record. That embeds
 security in the chain.
 ■  Smart contracts
allow people to make transactions based on transparent, known, and unchangeable rules. As a result, there is no need for middlemen to get between a company and its customers. The cost-savings from eliminating non-value adding parties can be passed on to
 consumers through lower prices or better products and services.
 ■  A
digital identity for customers (known as the self-sovereign digital identity) allows customers to keep a single digital identity for all their accounts, eliminating the need for burdensome logins and passwords.It also reduces the risk of security breaches
 by eliminating the need for central servers that store personally identifiable information.
Among the sectors that are already capitalizing - or looking to capitalize - on blockchain to enhance the customer experience are travel and tourism, health care and the automobile industry.

Travel Blockchain: More Efficient Traveler Security, Faster Bookings

In the travel industry, companies are experimenting with blockchain to improve the experience of tourists - everything from making security more efficient to faster bookings.
Shocard, for instance, is a startup that has developed a service for airlines that expedites the check-in process at airports and cuts the time customers spend in long queues. Passengers upload all their travel documents, which are registered on a blockchain.
 They are then given a single travel token that airlines can use to verify their identity quickly and securely.4
Another startup, Winding Tree, offers a decentralized travel distribution network. The Swiss company is working with six airlines and a hotel chain to create a shared booking platform with real-time information on holiday tour packages. The initiative is
 designed to circumvent the big distributors of travel services (which can charge package holiday providers commissions of up to 25%), thereby reducing the customer's costs.5


Health Care Blockchain: New Platform for Electronic Medical Records

In the health care industry, blockchain technology has enormous potential to make sharing medical records more efficient, secure and privacy compliant. A 2018 study found 14% of health care organizations expect to have a blockchain-based system in place
 by the end of the year, with 70% expecting to invest in implementations by 2020.6

Today, a patient's medical history rarely resides in a single place or file.Typically, electronic health records are held separately by hospitals, medical labs, clinicians and other healthcare institutions and professionals.The result: Patients and their
 doctors seldom have quick and easy access to a complete medical history, which can be critical to their care.
How can blockchain help? Every health record could be tagged with the patient's unique digital identity, encrypted, sent to cloud storage, and registered in the blockchain. To access these records, patients would use a private key and grant access to doctors
 and others who need to refer to their complete medical record. MedRec, based at the MIT Media Lab, is developing such a blockchain system.7
Insurers and health care providers also are experimenting with the technology. Nashville-based Change Healthcare, a network with 800,000 doctors, 117,000 dentists, and 60,000 pharmacies, has launched a blockchain to process insurance claims.8
 And a group including Humana Inc., Optum and Quest Diagnostics is working on a blockchain directory of health-care providers to make listings more accurate and accessible.9


Blockchain's Future (Curve 2): When Companies Partner with Customers on End-to-End Experiences

While blockchain technology can be used to help companies make their current business better, its greatest potential lies in helping companies innovate and make their business different. In his comments on The Blockchain Revolution, Apple co-founder Steve
 Wozniak says, ""We're at one of those times in technological, economic and social history where the sky is the limit.""10 In the blockchain-enabled world, consumers can become active producers of the goods and services they use - socalled ""prosumers."" As such,
 they can partner with companies and other organizations in decentralized networks that transact and create value.
Instead of offering customers just one or two parts of an overall desired ""life experience,"" companies could collaborate with them on shared platforms enabled by blockchain technology. For example, the birthday party business is a huge, recurring revenue
 generator around the world.Today, customers must cobble together the various products and services that go into creating a memorable celebration: the venue, the invitations, the food and drink, the entertainment, the party decorations, the transport to and
 from the venue, and so on. But in a blockchain-enabled world, it is possible to imagine that the different providers of the products and services for a birthday party could come together and, with the customer, design a bundled one-stop service that takes
 the stress out of the day, leaving the pleasure.

New Partners: Indigenous Peoples and the Tourists Who Visit Them

Already, one can find pioneering experimentation with blockchain in the travel and tourism industry. IDGO is a collaborative partnership working to ensure that the world's 370 million indigenous peoples can reap the rewardsof visitors to their communities
 and lands (as opposed to the current situation where they rarely enjoy the benefits of tourist revenue). IDGO's planned blockchain-enabled services include:11
■  A digital identity for indigenous people and for tourists who visit them and their lands. Tourists would pay a fee to receive a special passport, with proceeds going to the local community to be reinvested in environmental protection, education
 and indigenous cultural activities.
■  A community token and associated ""smart wallet."" One of the key components of blockchain technology - alongside the ledger, the smart contract and the digital identity - is the special token or coin known as a ""purpose-driven currency."" This provides
 a means of exchange between participants in the life experience ecosystem. With IDGO, the indigenous people can give tourists community tokens that can be used to pay for goods and services.
For instance, on Orchid Island, in Taiwan, the Tao people were largely unknown to the outside world before the 1960s. Ever since, they have seen a surge of tourists. Some 140,000 tourists now visit the island every year, generating income for travel companies
 but generating 120 tons of trash per month for the local people to clean up. Facing threats to their culture and environment, the Tao people hope the new blockchain-enabled partnership will help them accommodate the tourists (and the revenue they bring) while
 restoring their island to its former pristine state. And, if successful, IDGO plans to extend the partnership in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States: a $4 billion travel and hospitality market involving 500,000 indigenous people and 10 million
 tourists.12
In our view, experiments like these are just the beginning. Many other industries can transform the way they operate and enhance the customer experience with blockchain technology.

A Wellness Ecosystem for Health Care

Blockchain could help the healthcare industry transform its mission from treating sickness to improving health, the foundation for other life experiences. In the United States, 75% of healthcare expenditures go toward treating chronic problems: cardiovascular
 disease, cancer and diabetes. Given that all the industry's economic incentives reward procedural remedies (surgery and drugs), this is not surprising.
But there is another way - a blockchain-enabled wellness ecosystem - that could improve the health care system experience by facilitating collaboration and the efficient delivery of all healthcare services. Various stakeholders, collaborating through a blockchain-enabled
 network, could provide people with incentives to lead healthier lives.
Employers could give their employees reward tokens for exercising. Restaurants could provide customers with benefits for choosing healthy menu options. And insurers could compensate participating restaurants (since they benefit from individuals leading healthy
 lives). What's more, individual patients, as prosumers, could offer ideas for enhanced experiences based on their input and their participation levels in the varied offerings. Over time, such behavioral remedies could lead to a healthier population and reduce
 health care costs.

A Journey Ecosystem for the Auto Industry

The blockchain can transform the commuting experience, which would have major implications for the automotive industry. Around the world, cities are planning to protect the environment and improve their citizens' lives by banning cars. Hamburg, Germany,
 for example, plans to allow only pedestrians and bikers to enter certain areas.13 To counter this existential threat, automobile manufacturers could encourage car-sharing companies to join blockchain-enabled networks that promote intermodal transport.
One can imagine a journey ecosystem consisting of car-sharing companies, bike-sharing firms, office providers, restaurants, government agencies, shopping malls and housing communities. Together, the transport providers could create a single billing system,
 so customers could use a bike, car or train, and pay for all of them at one convenient location. At the same time, employers, government agencies and housing communities could use reward tokens to promote good transport habits, reducing congestion and pollution,
 and creating more engaged customers.

Action Plan:What Companies Need to Do Now

When deciding how to approach blockchain, it might seem tempting to focus first on optimizing the efficiencies of the existing business. But we recommend that companies conduct parallel programs that focus on both efficiency and life experience opportunities.
If companies delay experiments with life experience ecosystems, they risk disruption by networks of blockchain-connected competitors working collaboratively to create offerings that address a person's life holistically, rather than a focusing on a narrowly
 defined customer experience. Such life experiences will bring new levels of convenience and facilitate more meaningful ways for customers to interact with a company's offerings. This is an opportunity to pursue now, not later.
Once senior executives have decided to launch a parallel program (efficiency and life experience), they should create two teams staffed with full-time, dedicated business and technical specialists. The team focused on efficiency should look for innovative
 ways that blockchain can help the current business become more customer-focused; for instance, by removing some of the day-to-day friction that frustrates them. It should look to partner with suppliers and other business collaborators.
The other team should focus on life experience ecosystems, looking for inventive ways blockchain can be used to create new businesses that engage with customers (and competitors) in novel ways. This team should include experts skilled in disciplines such
 as behavioral psychology, game theory and self-governing organizations. They need to be able to think beyond traditional industry relationships and include customers as contributors of business value.
Although the teams should be separate and focused on different opportunities, they should, nevertheless, follow the same five-step innovation process:

1.   Strategic ideation.
Employ the efficiency team to analyze the company's current ecosystems, while the experience team analyzes all potentially relevant ecosystems. The teams should then map all the blockchain-enabled innovation opportunities for the different ecosystems.

2.   Portfolio development.
Create a portfolio of blockchain-enabled opportunities: the efficiency team identifying the innovations that will sustain existing products and services, and the experience team identifying disruptive innovations that could create new products and services
 to meet the growing customer demand for differentiating experiences.

3.   Business case development.
The teams draw up business cases for each of the opportunities.

4.   Prototyping and testing.
The teams provide demonstrable proof of the value of these opportunities, creating and testing prototype products and services in an agile, lean development approach.

5.   Greenlight the best.
Companies identify and implement the opportunities that are shown to have the greatest benefits for the company and its ecosystem partners.
An important final point to consider is this: Companies should take great care to adopt an open, collaborative approach to blockchain ideation and implementation. It is natural to think that the product of all this experimentation
 should be protected as valuable intellectual property. But companies that look to build walls around their inventions - as they have traditionally done - may struggle to succeed in the highly interdependent, interconnected blockchain era.
The people at the forefront of blockchain innovation, rekindling the spirit of the early days of the world wide web, are committed to working in open, collaborative ways. To attract this talent, companies need to embark on open, collective
 problem-solving initiatives.
Companies that erect walls around their innovation will be hard-pressed to match the speed of innovation possible with open source development with its transparent code base that can be tested, modified, and improved by
 people intrinsically motivated to do so.
No Time to Lose
Blockchain is a new technology. It is not surprising that many senior executives are still exploring the full implications of what it means for them and their companies. But they cannot afford to take too long to get up to
 speed. Blockchain innovation is occurring so swiftly that companies may be disrupted if they do not act soon. Right now, the chances arethat competitors, as well as new market entrants, are actively exploring potential blockchain-based innovations.
Accordingly, senior executives should make pursuing a two-pronged program of blockchain experimentation - seeking opportunities on both Curve 1 and Curve 2 - to help their company compete more effectively (by generating
 greater efficiencies) and collaborate more productively (by joining innovative networks focused on creating value).
If done right, they can hope to create an enduring relationship with newly engaged customers and position the company for a sustainable future in an age of disruption.

"
72,"
Large companies worldwide are moving their IT applications and infrastructure to the cloud, recognizing that creating innovative products and services and developing key strategic differentiators depends on the enormous computational
 resources that can be leveraged only through third-party cloud vendors.
This trend represents a shift in thinking about how and why companies deploy cloud computing. Previously, migrating to the cloud was considered a tactical play-a way to reduce IT costs and transform sunken capital expenditures into pay-as-you-go operating
 expenses. Today, moving apps and other IT systems to the cloud is viewed increasingly as a business-growth imperative, essential to revenue generation, competitive differentiation and meeting the requirements of agility, flexibility, scalability, availability.
There are many critical functions that cannot be implemented without the huge, round-the-clock computational resources of major public cloud vendors such as AWS, Microsoft or Google. And the cloud has become essential to helping companies offer a superior
 digital customer experience. Given that moving a business's IT to the cloud is a massive and complex effort, many companies struggle with where to begin. They must decide the order in which applications should be migrated. They must also determine whether
 proprietary information and sensitive data (especially customer data) should reside in a public, private or hybrid cloud-a question that has become increasingly fraught given the new and strict consumer privacy laws recently enacted in Europe and other countries.
Why tactical lift-and-shift cloud migration is inadequate


In the past, CIOs intended to take an IT-driven approach to cloud migration. The initial focus was on cost and the movement started with a lift and shift approach of moving tasks from on-premises systems to the cloud.
This tactical approach is not optimal because it is based on creating IT efficiencies rather than building strategic digital capabilities that can provide competitive advantages. Companies that lift-and-shift are addressing their existing challenges, but
 they are not considering the vast possibilities cloud systems offer, like application modernization, digital transformation and data monetization.
As an example, many companies attempt to modernize their systems by retaining their legacy mainframe and building an API layer on top of it, thereby accepting the limitations of the underlying system to respond to the needs of modern business. On the other
 hand, one major U.S. healthcare business is modernizing its sales and marketing applications by replacing its mainframe applications with Java-based applications using a microservices architecture in the cloud and thereby responding to the market needs of
 agility, flexibility and scalability.
Customer Example

A media-analysis firm uses microservices to boost agility

A leading media analysis and measurement firm needed to adapt to rapidly changing media consumption trends-including the rising utilization of mobile devices-to meet the needs of its clients. With the proliferation of digital technologies, it had been challenging
 to understand buyer preferences in digital channels. To address this, the company conceived a system with round-the-clock listening services capturing consumer data from a variety of digital channels and social media.

To do so, it deployed a loosely-coupled, modular microservices-based architecture enabling efficient data processing on multiple nodes. The system is inherently scalable and reliable, leveraging AWS1 RabbitMQ2 (an open-source message broker for cloud
 applications), and Redis3 (an open-source technology that supports automated database applications in the cloud).

This cloud-based system supports 200,000 concurrent users with data measurement every 10 seconds. It models around domain boundaries to reflect changes in business processes and is highly scalable with the ability to handle large volumes of measurement data.


Four Strategic Steps to Cloud Migration
Rather than lifting-and-shifting to save on IT overhead, companies should move away from their limiting legacy systems by re-architecting and transforming monolithic applications to a digital core.
Implementing a cloud-empowered digital transformation entails four steps: creating a strategy, devising an appropriate architecture, developing a migration roadmap and cloud migration.

Step 1: Establishing a Business-Driven Cloud Strategy
To develop a winning cloud-empowered strategy, executives need to identify applications and initiatives that that will drive company-wide success. Business drivers include risk, the competitive landscape, urgent business needs, growth opportunities, innovation
 as a differentiator, and the potential for developing new lines of business. Executives also need to examine cloud migration in terms of ""as-is versus the target state,"" prioritizing both immediate opportunities and critical digital transformation needs.
Achieving digital maturity should be a key goal for cloud migration strategies. With the proliferation of new, critical and powerful technologies, digital maturity is essential for aligning the business with transformative business model operations, such
 as those deployed by Uber and Airbnb, and modernized processes adopted in the transportation and finance sectors with, respectively, automated booking and mobile banking. Digital maturity consists of building new cloud-native capabilities, transforming the
 architecture and leveraging business and contextual knowledge.
Executives should also examine new data opportunities unleashed in the cloud by exploring the possibilities to leverage data as an asset. For example, by working within a partner ecosystem, a company can expose data in a secured manner and regulatory compliant
 manner to monetize data. Leveraging cloud-native technologies can reveal new revenue streams, fueling business growth. Banks, for instance, are using data for creating expanded (and profitable) customer service ecosystems, while information services companies
 are leveraging cloud-native technologies to capture their target audience and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Hyper-growth is only possible with a clear digital agenda, a platform-based approach, multi-cloud integration, API implementation
 and microservices.information services companies are leveraging cloud-native technologies to capture their target audience and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Hyper-growth is only possible with a clear digital agenda, a platform-based approach,
 multi-cloud integration, API implementation and microservices.

Step 2: Defining the Optimal Architecture

Once the strategy is established, the company should turn its attention to cloud architecture. Defining an optimal architecture ensures that cloud migration is executed in a way that matches the business strategy with regulatory compliance and data security
 constraints, among others. Depending on these constraints, the right architecture may be public, private, or a hybrid approach. Key factors to consider include needs for agility, scalability, availability, data sensitivity/risk profile, innovation, time to
 market and cost.
For example, a healthcare company or financial institution may maintain customer data in a private cloud to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive, regulated data and move some of the applications to a public cloud. In contrast, a retailer may prioritize
 the ability to scale up and down quickly as demand fluctuates, such as at holiday peak times, and leverage a public cloud. For online services such as Netflix or Hulu, the most important consideration may be availability and failover to prevent customer-frustrating
 outages; they may need a microservice-based architecture with redundancy to ensure smooth functioning. In industries like pharma, where innovation is critical, the cloud applications with a serverless architecture may deliver the ability to process and analyze
 data more quickly to meet business needs.
Architecture may also address such factors as how to consolidate data processing from disconnected entities, and how to avoid getting locked into any single cloud vendor's platform. Or, it may address the need for geo-replicated solutions, addressing regional
 regulatory compliance demands. For example, a pharmaceutical company may design its cloud architecture to support a globally distributed access-management solution, with variations to ensure compliance with a complex variety of regional regulations.

Step 3: Creating the Roadmap
In addition to a business-driven strategy and an architecture that conforms with a business's needs and market constraints, companies should develop a roadmap that ensures a seamless migration to the cloud. The roadmap incorporates such factors as how to
 implement migration with minimal impact on business units or on currently operating IT systems. It also identifies strategies to follow for analytical applications (such as in data lakes) and addresses how to handle commercial off-the-shelf applications, such
 as a company's ERP system.In addition to a business-driven strategy and an architecture that conforms with a business's needs and market constraints, companies should develop a roadmap that ensures a seamless migration to the cloud. The roadmap incorporates
 such factors as how to implement migration with minimal impact on business units or on currently operating IT systems. It also identifies strategies to follow for analytical applications (such as in data lakes) and addresses how to handle commercial off-the-shelf
 applications, such as a company's ERP system. 
In practice, companies tend to address cloud-based modernization roadmaps via one of the following four approaches:
■  Savings first, modernization later.In this case, the company's priority is cutting costs. Migrate the cost-intensive applications and resources to the cloud first and free up the overhead costs of data centers. Consider the modernization of specific
 applications at a later stage based on specific business needs.
This path is usually taken due to constraints such as limited resources, security concerns, or change management considerations. This roadmap is typically chosen by companies with mid-size application footprints, mostly in the retail, hospitality, travel
 and insurance sectors.
■  Modernization first, then business model transformation.This roadmap seeks to use the cloud to leverage technological advances to drive current business improvements that transform the business model. This roadmap is often chosen by companies with
 a small application footprint but a strong digital agenda.
The banking and financial services industry sees this approach playing out. For example, a Nordic bank has modernized its payment applications and transformed the business model leveraging microservices and an APIbased architecture. A major European bank,
 meanwhile has responded to its market conditions-including competition from fintechs, as well as new regulatory requirements-by seeking to future-proof itself with a transformational digital banking strategy. It is leveraging cloud APIs to create a common
 ecosystem with partners and other fintechs, driving thirdparty innovation that benefits the bank and its ecosystem partners. In so doing, the bank has defined the future-state architecture for API banking. Its business goals include increasing agility, reducing
 time to market, creating new revenue streams, and enabling new business models.
■  Entering the cloud through data services.Organizations with data lakes and heavy analytical applications are planning to leverage the cloud to modernize their analytical applications. Here, the roadmap begins with modernization and movement to
 the cloud of their analytical applications. The remaining applications may stay on-premise or move to the cloud based on a firm’s overall cloud strategy.
For example, a major European postal services company has devised a strategy to move their business intelligence applications along with the data marts holding more than 50 Terabytes of data to the public cloud and connecting its on-premise applications
 through a dedicated data pipe. The strategy for migrating the other applications will be framed parallel to the above initiative.
■  Enabling a superior last-mile experience.Some businesses with heavy monolithic and legacy commercial off-the-shelf systems (such as ERP and CRM) are looking at the cloud to enable state-of-the-art user experiences for their business with a mobile
 layer on top of their existing application landscape.
For example, a government insurance business based in the Middle East has leveraged cloud-native technologies to build a mobile user interface for a selected set of their commercial off-the-shelf functionalities.
Customer Example

A bank uses ""APIfication"" for innovation

A leading European bank implemented an APIfication strategy to innovate more quickly and lay the groundwork for a series of new customer-facing apps. There were three business drivers for this. First, to adopt new digital banking business models with a partner
 ecosystem. Second, to take a leadership position in a changing landscape with increasing competition from fintechs. Third, to comply with the European Union's revised payment services directive, PSD2.

The solution included designing an API banking architecture, comprised of high-level architecture, process flows, security and data models. It leveraged Apigee,4 a Google API platform, and node.js, an open-source server environment.

The project established an ecosystem to work with partners and fintechs, to drive innovation. It also created new business models and revenue streams, while complying with PSD2 regulations.

Step 4: Choosing the Path to Cloud Migration

Effective deployment of the cloud strategy and roadmap ensures success of the cloud migration initiative. There are three varieties of cloud migration: low touch, high touch and modernization, as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1: Low Touch, High Touch and Modernization Paths to Cloud Migration


Low touch migration deals with the lift and shift of applications to the cloud. It involves low-risk, highly automated, catalogue-based migration services of applications and data. This approach has a rapid scale up capability.
High touch migration involves refactoring of applications (i.e., they can be moved to the cloud with configuration changes and minor modifications) or re-platforming of applications (i.e., they can be deployed on different
 operating systems with minor modifications). It requires a configurable, variable, application-specific approach with strong transparency in terms of the costs and timeline to completion.
Application modernization services includes applications reengineering, new development and is artisanal in nature. This leverages what we call Business 4.0 principles-the fourth industrial revolution in which
 successful businesses will use people, technology and data to be intelligent, agile and automated, and on the cloud.

Not Easy, But Worth It

Implementing a cloud-empowered business modernization effort is a major undertaking for any company. It will affect nearly every aspect of the business, from front-end customer-facing applications and processes to back-end financial and inventory systems.
 As such, there are key barriers that every company must overcome to be successful.
Not surprisingly, the effort will demand careful planning to create an appropriate strategy, architecture and roadmap. A company, no matter its size, must be prepared to rethink how it addresses its key business drivers. Based on that, it must develop and
 execute the plan over the course of months and commit sufficient resources to the effort. Perhaps most importantly, the company must create a leadership team with broad support and participation from the C-suite, operations and affected business units, as
 well as from the tech team. It must avoid allowing the IT team to drive the process based on its (or the company's) tactical, short-term needs. A shared vision and thorough buy-in from all these stakeholders ensures the best possible outcome.
Once the plan is agreed to, the company must verify that it has the requisite tech capabilities (and talent) to work with its chosen vendor to develop, test, and implement the project without compromising its ongoing operations. And it must do its due diligence
 to be sure that the vendor has the experience and capacity to help engineer an optimal transformation that will prepare the company for a cloud-driven future.
To help clients achieve their digital transformation, the vendors should provide a portfolio of methodologies. It must have decision, migration and modernization services to help the company achieve its digital transformation with a set of automated accelerators,
 in a factory-delivery model. And it must offer a full range of capacities to implement microservices, serverless architecture, containers, ecosystem intermediation, and hybrid integration.
Finally, it must possess business-context knowledge to help customers achieve their application transformation and capture new opportunities.
Once cloud migration is complete, companies must be organized to innovate and iterate continuously lest the point of the migration be missed. With a well-designed cloud-based digital transformation, future innovations will be far easier and quicker to implement.
Customer Example

An airline uses a hybrid cloud integration to manage schedules

A leading U.S. airline deployed hybrid integration to plan crew schedules. The business drivers included the need to manage multiple sources of crew information across various domains (crew profile, planning and operations) for various channels, and keeping
 up with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules. 
The airline's solution entailed an enterprise-wide platform for integrated crew domain information. It eliminated point-to-point communication and tight coupling between systems, and published services for users leveraging a cloud-based integration platform-as-a-service
 (iPaaS). The system enabled the airline to establish automated business rules. Via this cloud solution, the crew can manage its own activities more efficiently (and within regulations), with operations using multiple channels to oversee their activity.

A Business Imperative

Technology is reshaping the world of commerce in profound ways. Companies like Amazon, Lyft, Google and Netflix are redefining customer expectations, and those expectations now apply across their interactions with all industry sectors, from hospitality to
 banking, from transportation to entertainment. Customers expect all their interactions to be seamless; they expect the companies with which they interact to respond to them quickly, knowing who they are and the history of their past transactions.
Only cloud-based solutions offer the agility and power needed to accomplish that. We believe that there is simply no way to compete in the modern business world without embracing the cloud and capitalizing on its potential for digital transformation. Call
 it future-proofing the business. Companies ignore the cloud at their peril, and those who embrace it early and most effectively will be prepared to deliver a superior customer experience while benefiting from a host of operational improvements.
As we have stressed, the key to successfully deploying cloud solutions is developing a strategy, architecture and an implementation roadmap that incorporates the company’s vital business interests and drivers. If the company has not already done so, establishing
 a cross-functional team with the authority and capacity to carry out the cloud-empowered strategic transformation is an urgent business imperative.

"
73,"Digital transformations are performed with a range of justifications.
Some stem from a need to replace IT systems that have reached the end of their useful life; others from a reluctance to spend on a refresh. These companies' often complex IT infrastructures can't keep up with the pace of service demands.
 That leads to lackluster service levels for customers, and for mobile workers seeking help with creaky legacy systems and applications that often are fragile, prone to breakdowns, and neither scalable nor flexible enough to take on new service demands. In
 some cases, a company lacks the skills required to tend to its legacy systems, creating the risk that it will have trouble keeping them running. And, as technology vendors move their systems to cloud-enabled platforms, enterprises that have the on-premises
 versions of those applications eventually will find their vendors' support withdrawn.
Other companies embarking on a digital transformation seek a reset; they wish to establish a greenfield on which to build a fresh IT infrastructure for new ventures and innovative business models. Often, this happens when a company
 goes through a merger, acquisition or divestiture. While these events provide a chance to start a fresh computing environment, the new entity in all likelihood will be accessing existing data. This means that the new entity and its predecessors must ensure
 the disparate data sets, once held by parts of an organization that were together, can be managed separately.
Whatever the reason, a digital transformation will require any enterprise to shift much of its computing infrastructure from its own data centers to those operated by private or public cloud providers.
A cloud-based digital transformation strategy offers great opportunities:
■  Reduced costs.
■  The chance to capitalize on far greater computational resources provided by cloud providers that run data-intensive computing chores
■  Replacements for aging back-office applications
■  The flexibility to ramp up or down according to business needs
■  The ability to handle the enormous volumes of data coming from Internet of Things-related digital sensors (from machines in the field, products in customers' hands and places of business)
■  Resources to support the use of artificial intelligence and other systems that identify business opportunities, solve operational problems and provide winning digital customer experiences.
The cloud is full of promise. But while straightforward in theory, the switchover of systems from a company's data centers to the cloud must be planned carefully. If the planning isn't sound, it will risk major disruptions to the
 information systems that the business depends upon every day. Thus, in the absence of considerable forethought, a company's digital transformation initiatives are likely to falter.
Because a digital transformation is about the future of the business, the planning to support it should hinge on the business's strategy. not on IT-centric concerns. Executives must focus first on what is relevant to the growth of
 their business, and how a cloud deployment can support that strategy. Decisions on the technology resources to support that strategy come afterwards. And while it shifts systems to the cloud, the organization must keep a laser focus on those who will experience
 the systems that the cloud supports-both internal users and customers.

The Cloud Beckons
The debate about whether to join the cloud computing trend is history. A survey of nearly 1,000 IT professionals found 96% of their organizations have active cloud implementations, and 81% have more than one.1 The cloud
 is an integral part of digital transformations, just as it is central to most modern IT programs.
The move to digital transformation - to serve customers better and faster and bring new products and services to market more quickly and frequently - requires access to new applications like advanced analytics. Without them, a firms
 ability to gain needed insights from the data it collects about customers and its own operating performance will be constrained. And without the processing power of a public cloud vendor, companies will find it difficult to analyze the enormous volume of data
 that will be generated by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors.
Traditional IT systems are not suited to digital transformations. They are not flexible enough. They are not responsive enough. They are costly to maintain. And technology vendors are moving away from supporting their on-premises
 applications.
Corporate leaders can't justify spending more on the IT systems they have in place. That's pouring good money after bad. And so, for digital transformations, the cloud beckons. The question for companies is how to answer the call.
Business Strategy Guides Cloud Implementation Approach

 Incorporating a cloud computing infrastructure into a company's digital transformation initiative starts with making the business case. Executives must explain how a cloud infrastructure can support the digital transformation. This includes stating how the
 company's digital transformation will reshape the business for the better, how it will empower the company to innovate and grow, and how cloud computing will serve as a catalyst.
The capabilities of a cloud infrastructure should address these questions:

■  Stability - to access resources where and when they are needed. A cloud computing provider can ensure the stability of fragile legacy systems.

■  Flexibility - to scale computing resources up or down as demand requires.

■  Security - from private clouds that connect legacy systems via corporate wide-area networks, and ensure the data security of IoT implementations.

■  Agility - a readily accessible test bed for new products and services.

■  Access to innovative technologies - cloud providers host the latest applications, updated automatically, along with computing resources to gain new insight into data and pursue new initiatives.
After determining the benefits of a cloud strategy, a company's leaders must assess their current environment. How ready is the organization's current computing environment? What is required
 to reach the desired future state? For each issue below, executives need to identify current requirements, project future requirements and determine the difference between those desired states and the company's existing conditions. Issues include:
■  Business Considerations including the company's industry and its existing digital processes. For example, an industrial manufacturer may be building out an IoT system to embed sensors to monitor
 performance and predict problems in the machines it sells and fix them before they occur. That company is likely to have different requirements than a retailer revamping its omnichannel customer experience to reach consumers using smartphone and smart speakers
 like Amazon's Alexa. Each company will have a list of contingencies for its cloud infrastructure to ensure its ongoing operations run smoothly, it existing applications are maintained, and new capabilities can be accommodated.
■  Applications, including legacy enterprise applications (like ERP, CRM, supply chain), office systems including call center and other communications, as well as analytics and other applications that support the
 business. The company needs to understand the specific ramifications for supporting these applications with a new cloud infrastructure, and how to ensure continuous service to employees and customers.
■  Infrastructure. The company should outline its existing capabilities, and what it will require for the digital transformation.
This exercise is about laying the foundation for a future in which infrastructure requirements can support future growth. By identify gaps between today's reality and the company's vision, executives can pinpoint how to close those
 gaps.
Determining a Migration Path

With a vision articulated and an understanding of the business contingencies a cloud infrastructure must include, the next step is to determine a path forward.


The choices executives make - whether to go with a public cloud provider, a private cloud host or a hybrid model - will depend on the business. Private cloud models, such as infrastructure as a service (computing resources provided on an as-needed basis) and
 platform as a service (tools hosted on a cloud platform that enable teams to develop and test new applications, products and services), are often better suited to companies moving deliberately toward the cloud.

In addition, public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google offer scalability for ""dynamic burst"" - the ability to handle processing chores during peak volume times (such
 as a retailer's holiday season e-commerce orders). Software-as-a-service providers, such as Salesforce.com's customer relationship management applications, host specific business capabilities and related data.
Executives should also consider whether hybrid clouds, a model that combines elements of public and private cloud resources, are right for their digital transformation. The model is a popular choice because
 companies can run versions of their existing systems while taking advantage of the best of additional resources and technologies.
For every migration path a company evaluates, executives should perform a total cost of ownership analysis that includes the costs of labor, technology and other expenses - compared to existing conditions-as well as calculating
 projections for the expected returns.
The Swiss Army Knife Nature of Cloud Infrastructures

The digital transformations ongoing at two very different businesses show how the versatility of cloud infrastructures can support a range of initiatives.


Private cloud stabilizes company at risk, sets stage for rebound The story of a delivery and logistics company shows how a successful cloud migration plan can enable a digital transformation. The company, which serves large but sparsely populated regions,
 faced complaints about poor service. 
The company's creaky systems had trouble dealing with seasonal demand spikes. Competition from other logistics firms ate into the company's business. The firm saw its orders drop 15% during the first 15
 years of the 21st century. It was in danger of going out of business.
At issue was the company's legacy systems, which could not change as the environment around the company changed. Somehow, it had to stabilize its legacy systems while its executives planned a larger digital
 transformation to meet new market demands.
With a private cloud, the company's users could access important applications that previously were prone to breaking down. The private cloud also drove an early victory: the launch of a digital platform
 on which business transformation applications could be built in an agile model. The system added new functionality while improving customer service.
The company continued to plan for the future as it built on this early success. It created new value-added services, like booking online appointments for collection and delivery services. Now the company
 is more agile than before. It can meet seasonal spikes. And its existence is no longer in doubt.
Discrete cloud environments establish integrity of parent company and its spinoff
The second example illustrates the opportunity a cloud implementation presents when a large industrial company decides to spin off a business. When executives at the manufacturer decided to split off part
 of itself into a new company, each entity needed to have its own IT infrastructure complete with separate systems and independent data stores.
The scale of the original company's systems made this complicated: more than 1,300 business applications, including business analytics and financial management systems; systems for critical business processes
 including manufacturing, supply chain, finance and HR, and legacy systems including multiple regional instances of Oracle E-Business Suite for ERP, CRM and supply chain management. The original company had 1.6 petabytes of data that had to be segregated and
 moved during the divestiture process. And the migration to two new computing environments had to meet a tight deadline (one business quarter), while complying with government financial regulations and security requirements.
The company relied on TCS Enterprise Private Cloud to make the divestiture work. It established separate infrastructures for the two companies. Each company set up its own instance of Oracle E-Business Suite. Each unit
 also established control of all data relevant to its business.
The divestiture transaction was completed on time, with each company beginning operations on the planned date, each supported by its own cloud computing infrastructures.
Finishing Touches Required

As the examples of companies using cloud infrastructures to enable dramatic changes illustrate, cloud implementations alter the workings of every important system that employees and customers touch. Creating the conditions
 for a successful cloud migration requires collaboration among decision-makers, those implementing changes, and employees who will be working in new digital environments.
Some of the challenges that need to be overcome in successful transformations include:
■  Regulatory compliance. Like the divestiture noted above, cloud infrastructure implementations must follow applicable accounting rules relating to financial data, as well as privacy rules for
 customer information. This requires close collaboration between business stakeholders and cloud infrastructure partners. The parties must validate compliance before the systems go live. For example, they need to confirm the datasets that correspond to each
 business entity are stored properly in the correct systems and applications.
■  Security compliance.In the transition to a cloud infrastructure, the company and its cloud partner must confirm that data is handled in compliance with government rules, corporate policies and
 customer agreements. For example, security features can include data encryption and monitoring data access in addition to the network and system security features that a cloud provider should provide.
■  Change management.The migration to a cloud infrastructure should incorporate all the training and change management efforts that go into any successful IT implementation influencing business processes and the
 work of end users.
A Host for Transformations

Digital transformations are a boardroom imperative. The issue is one of the top three priorities for 2018 in 11 out of 15 industries, according to a Gartner survey of 3,160 CIOs across 98 countries.2 International Data
 Corp. predicts spending on digital initiatives will grow to close to $1.3 trillion in 2018 and surpass $2.1 trillion by 2021.3
But while digital transformations are a priority, success is elusive. Only 5% of global companies had met or exceeded their digital goals, according to a 2017 Bain and Company survey of more than 1,000
 companiesless than half the success rate for conventional transformations.4
One thing that is certain: the ability of cloud infrastructures to support transformation initiatives. The cloud provides the agility, access to innovative analytics applications and ready-made testing
 environments in which to create and test new products and services. Companies can run their business on it, change their business through it, connect with customers and improve the lives of their employees.
There are so many choices for moving forward that the biggest challenges are specifying the reasons for adopting a cloud infrastructure, determining how you will integrate your business with it, and
 then implementing it. Your transformation is out there. The cloud is ready for it.

74,"
Today, digital customer experience transformations are mandatory to stay ahead in business, not optional. Customers are demanding cutting-edge digital experiences, delivered on every channel, via every device, anytime and anywhere
 they desire. To satisfy these customers, companies are transforming their digital platforms, processes, and practices, leveraging new technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, and implementing Lean approaches and Design Thinking.
But although digital transformations are required, they are not risk free. These transformational projects generate a dizzying array of new cybersecurity risks. New digital processes generate mountains of customer data. Much of this
 data is stored inside the organization; some is shared with business partners. More data, stored in multiple places, provides a bigger, softer target for external hackers and internal bad actors.
The stakes are high. Any breach or leak of customer data can cost significant money to address. It also can incur the wrath of regulators and do serious damage to a company's reputation.
Consequently, any company embarking on the digital transformation of their customer experience must make cybersecurity an integral part of their organizational culture.
Every New Touchpoint Brings New Risks

Right now, companies are supplying their customers with billions of digital apps, devices, and smart, internet-connected products - kitchen appliances, medical devices, cars - that, together, comprise the Internet of Things (IoT).
 And every new app, device, and gizmo accesses and generates data.
Traditionally, companies stored data - both customer and transactional - in a centralized and controlled manner, within the company's four walls, in databases that were guarded and protected. Today, that kind of control is impossible,
 and not even desirable. Data is generated everywhere, all the time, flowing into the organization from millions of distributed devices in the hands of customers and partners, not to mention from sensors critical to business operations in sectors ranging from
 retail to telecommunications to manufacturing.
These connected devices are proliferating at an astonishing rate. According to Gartner, there will be 20.4 billion connected devices in use worldwide by 2020, more than double the number deployed at the end of 2017.1
Each of these connected digital devices serves as a touchpoint through which companies and customers interact for purposes of marketing, sales, customer service, payments and more. And each of these billions of touchpoints represents
 a potential point of attack that people with bad intentions - either criminal hackers or disgruntled employees - can exploit. Data theft or misuse not only constitutes a reputational and financial risk to corporations but could have disruptive impact on customers'
 lives. For example:
■  In 2017, Wired warned that connected medical equipment - from sensors and monitors to implantable devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps - were all vulnerable to hack attacks. Once they gain access, hackers could steal medical records, execute
 ransomware attacks or even cause a device to malfunction so that, for example, a patient might receive a fatal overdose of insulin.2
■  White hat hackers publicized the fact in 2017 that they had been able to access the infotainment system - including microphone, navigation system and speakers - on certain Volkswagen and Audi models.3 As automakers move forward with plans for
 hands-free driving, and eventually fully autonomous vehicles, the health and safety implications of hack attacks on connected cars becomes realistically dire.
■  More and more consumers are stocking their homes with IoT devices including baby monitors, security cameras, doorbells and thermostats. But researchers at Israel's Ben-Gurion University found that the security protocols on such off-the-shelf IoT devices
 were easily breached.4 Indeed, there are anecdotal reports of malevolent strangers hacking into baby monitors to shout insults at children and their parents, play music or hijack control of the camera.5
■  At the 2017 Mobile World Congress Americas, an IoT Security expert conducted a live hack attack on a fictional home with multiple IoT devices, quickly taking control of an Amazon Echo, IP camera, smart alarm and smart lock to gain physical access to the
 home.6 This scenario is especially troubling given Berg Insight's prediction that more than half of all homes in North America will become smart homes by the year 2021.7
Pouring Money into the Wrong Buckets

Companies know that cybersecurity risks are rising; they want to protect themselves and their customers, so they are ramping up their cybersecurity spending. IDC predicts that spending on security-related hardware, software and services
 will reach $91.4 billion worldwide in 2018, a 10.2 percent increase over 2017.8 Spending on cybersecurity will continue to soar over the next three years, especially in the telecommunications sector where IDC projects a 13% CAGR in cybersecurity
 investments.

But are companies making the right sort of cybersecurity investments? We believe that in the absence of a new strategy cybersecurity, simply increasing the size of the cybersecurity spend will not be sufficient to cope with the magnitude of the threat at hand.

Here are four reasons why companies cannot rely on more of the same when it comes to cybersecurity:


1. Reactive solutions are no longer sufficient. Cybersecurity practitioners have traditionally focused on detecting problems and then reacting to them with countermeasures.

This strategy no longer suffices in 2018, as hackers can now do more damage more quickly and have become more adept at hiding their tracks.


2. Data is everywhere, and it is largely unstructured. Legacy cybersecurity models focused on protecting structured data that lived within a corporate database. But now data is unstructured, coming into the
 enterprise a wide variety of formats, from word files and spreadsheets to images, videos, audio and more. In addition, critical corporate data now resides everywhere, in the cloud and on billions of devices scattered across the planet. (According to Gartner,
 there will be 20.4 billion internet-connect ""things"" by 2020.9) One cannot erect a firewall around every individual with a smartphone or laptop or digital assistant everywhere in the world.


3. Companies no longer own the devices that hold their data. Before the IoT, cybersecurity teams could focus on hardening defenses around a select group of internal IT systems, data centers, and networks. But today there are
 billions of IoT devices, each a potential entry point for an attacker. For example, Target suffered a damaging breach after hackers gained access to its payment systems and stole login credentials through an internet-connected HVAC system.10
For a hacker, any IoT device could be the back door to the larger system. In a hospital, it could be an internet-connected MRI machine or CT scanner. In a household, it could be an appliance or a digital assistant. Recently, researchers
 have demonstrated their ability to eavesdrop and record voices of people using Amazon's popular Alexa-enabled Echo speaker.11
And it's not just devices. Even browsers or apps can give hackers a way into the enterprise. Today, it is no longer possible to draw a bright line around where the corporate network begins or ends.


4. Existing strategies cannot meet new regulatory requirements. The regulatory landscape is shifting underfoot. Unnerved by the vast attack on U.S. credit bureau Equifax that exposed the personally identifiable information
 of approximately 145.5 million Americans and disturbed by the way social media companies have sold access to user data without their users' knowledge or permission, governments are promulgating ever stricter privacy regulations and laws.
In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018, requiring organizations with users or customers in the EU to do a better job of protecting customers' personal data. This has forced many U.S.
 companies to re-write their privacy policies, and in some cases de-identify and encrypt data they already possess.
In addition, individual countries are passing their own privacy regulations forcing companies to store data on their citizens within those countries' national borders. As a result, corporations that once consolidated as much data
 as possible within a single controlled location must now operate and secure multiple data warehouses all over the world. This proliferation of data centers both magnifies overhead costs and increases the complexity of blocking hackers from gaining access to
 steal data or otherwise wreak havoc.
Making Cybersecurity an Integral Part of the Strategy to Transform the Digital Customer Experience

Going forward, a successful cybersecurity strategy will need to have four components:


1. Instead of focusing on a warehouse, a facility, a geography or a system, cybersecurity must be
data-centric. That is, the company must commit to protecting its data and its customers' data wherever it resides.



2. Cybersecurity strategy must become
flexible. Regulations will continue to change. Connected devices will proliferate. Data will continue to multiply. A company's cybersecurity strategy must be able to change dynamically.



3. Cybersecurity must put a major emphasis on 
predictive capabilities. Ideally, companies should have the cybersecurity capabilities to identify and mitigate risks before they become a problem. What's better than stopping a hacker in his or her tracks? Stopping the hack attack from occurring in the
 first place. 
Big data and analytics tools have a major role to play in pinpointing problematic transactions and probing intrusions so that companies can take steps to shut down emergent threats.


4. It must be inclusive, encompassing the protection of both the company's intellectual property as well as its customer data.

Protecting the organization's data from cyber-attacks starts with an understanding of the internal and external vulnerabilities your business faces. Having a well-rounded strategy and approach, coupled with proactive
 threat hunting, will enable organizations to focus their resources on the entry points where hackers can gain entry to systems.
Risk Analysis Baked into the Design


Too few organizations use a risk-based approach when considering which digital systems to implement.

Rather than trying to wrap a security blanket around an inherently vulnerable system, companies should make sure that cybersecurity experts have a key role in designing, building and testing the digital systems and processes used
 to safeguard IP, protect customer data and keep companies in regulatory compliance.

Gone are the days when companies could relegate cybersecurity strategy to their IT departments; this is a business issue. Organizations need to employ an approach that integrates cyber protection into all aspects of the organization,
 from employee training to sales to finance to operations. 
Complying with Regulations, Weighing the Costs


As noted, the EU's new GDPR regulations place new privacy and data protection responsibilities onto corporations.
Obviously, companies must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where they do business. But as new cybersecurity rules multiply and come into force, companies may need to make some hard decisions about
 whether it makes financial and strategic sense to do business in certain countries.
For example, some countries are now passing laws saying data on their citizens must reside within their borders. Companies will need to calculate the costs and benefits of complying with those rules:
■  What are the financial costs of setting up these new distributed data centers?
■  Will the company need to make major changes to its cybersecurity strategy or protocols to move from a few centralized data centers to many far-flung facilities?
■  Will the logistical and operational challenges of securing these multiple data centers distract the cybersecurity team from focusing on other, more important threats to its core systems?
In some cases, it could make sense for a company to pull back from noncore markets or countries rather than incur the additional costs, risks and distractions of complying with especially burdensome regulations.
Prioritize, Then Pursue


Every system has flaws. Every program has bugs. The key is to figure out which flaws and bugs are mere annoyances, and which are existential threats.
Whether a company's data lives in a data center or a cloud computing environment, the cybersecurity team must be adept at identifying the most significant risks and prioritizing fixes based on two criteria:


1. Does the risk represent a threat to core business operations? In other words, if a system goes down or is taken offline, will the result be a minor annoyance or a major disaster? Will the repercussions be
 a minor embarrassment or a major hit to the stock price? 


2. Could the threat involve customer data, especially personally identifiable information (PII)? If hackers get access to customers' names, emails, addresses and birth dates, that might not have any discernable effect on day-to-day
 operations, but it could cause devastating reputational damage and lead to unpleasant regulatory, legal and political repercussions.

By assessing whether threats overlap with either of these two red flag areas-core business operations and/or PII customer data-cybersecurity teams will know where to focus their efforts. Other issues can wait. These
 are the threats that must be addressed immediately.
Challenges - People, Skills and Frameworks


Cybersecurity teams must overcome two key challenges if they hope to keep their organizations safe from disaster:


1. Finding and training the right people. Currently, companies are having difficulty hiring and training people fast enough to keep up with the pace of change in the cybersecurity world. According to a recent
 workforce report, there will be a 1.5 million-person shortfall by 2020 in cybersecurity talent.12

Threats are evolving faster and faster. Each new technology comes with a steep learning curve. Yet, at the same time, each new cybersecurity tool has a shorter shelf life than the previous generation. Hardwarebased firewalls were
 the foundation of cybersecurity for a decade but have now given way to software-defined networks where everything is virtual, including the firewall.

The most important skill that cybersecurity professionals need today is the ability to orchestrate, collect and interpret data from multiple security tools. They need to filter the information and figure out where to take action first,
 according to the prioritization methods outlined above. 
To address the shortfall of cyber security talent, organizations will have to invest on in-house talent development programs and leverage digital technologies for virtual training. Investments in robust training content and virtual
 labs on cloud for hands-on trainings are key to a successful talent development program.



2. Building a robust rules-based framework. Security organizations typically find themselves deluged by detected threats. But, as noted, not all risks deserve equal attention. Some can be safely ignored (or
 at least put on the back burner); others require the undivided, instant attention of first-responders.

Companies can significantly reduce their cybersecurity risks by making sure they have a strong, rules-based framework in place to help team members properly prioritize security threats and responses. Some sample prioritization rules
 could include: 
■  Prioritize threats to systems that are critical to business operations, including financial and customer transactions.
■  Prioritize threats to systems and databases that contain PII, as breaches in those areas would expose the company to regulatory and reputational damages.
■  Prioritize repairs in systems that connect to the internet, as they are vulnerable to external hackers who can then move horizontally to access a business's entire network or outward to interfere with customer systems.
Cybersecurity departments will never have infinite resources or infinite time to fix known problems, so having this type of clear, comprehensive rules-based framework plays a critical role in making sure that team members rank risks
 appropriately and use their time wisely to mitigate the most severe threats. 
Start with Security
The overarching challenge facing corporate security leaders today may not be new-customers and users have always wanted maximum access and availability, and bad actors have always probed for ways to defeat defenses-but what is new
 is that the opportunities for mischief and the vectors for crime have multiplied. With data residing everywhere-and increasingly outside the four walls of the business-we live and work in an ever-expanding universe of vulnerabilities, with every point in that
 universe connected to another. This is both the strength and the weakness of modern technology-driven business.

This increasingly robust and useful web of connected systems and devices presents businesses with a tremendous opportunity to develop new customer experiences to meet expectations and delight consumers. But it also demands that enterprises
 embed cybersecurity considerations into the design, development and testing of these new experiences, and the digital products and services that make them possible. The best and most cost-effective time to consider the cybersecurity consequences of all these
 innovative products, services, and experiences is at the beginning, when they are still a gleam in the business's eye, and before something bad happens.

They say that prevention is worth a pound of cure. That's never been truer than it is today.

75,"
Internet of Things (IoT) technologies present businesses with unprecedented opportunities. The IoT enables companies to embed digital technology into the products they sell, creating new value streams and new aftermarkets. It drives
 supply chains that turn components into products and bring them to market, creating new top- and bottom-line efficiencies. It can track and reveal consumer preferences and behaviors, generating new insights and improved digital customer experiences that produce
 loyalty and new revenue. And that just scratches the surface.
IoT technologies are increasingly are found in products ranging from refrigerators to aircraft engines; small digital cameras attached to the inside and outside of buildings (think of retail stores and amusement parks); digital bracelets
 that customers wear and which let a company know where the customer is on its premises (such as at a theme park). IoT technologies allow companies to:
■  Understand how their products are performing. By analyzing usage data, companies can improve product performance, and predict when they need service (before they break down), allowing companies to offer new services that customers can depend upon.
■  Track the movement and actions of customers on the company's premises and enhance their experience by, for example, reorganizing queues and offering add-on services that will ease access to high-traffic areas.
■  Monitor employees and their interactions with customers so that, for example, retail workers and managers can brainstorm to slash wait times at checkout.
These capabilities exemplify a ""closed loop"" system in which a company can combine the performance data it collects from the field with data from its other systems - ERP, supply chain, financial, CRM systems and more - to better serve
 customers. A closed loop system moves a company from static and reactive to dynamic and proactive; from relying on historic information to basing decisions on real-time data. Thus, the IoT is an enabler of what we call Business 4.0: the modern state of business
 in which firms can use abundant data, agile approaches to business, automation technologies and computing resources to drive their enterprises.
With the realization that the IoT delivers value while enriching customer experiences, many companies have been spending big money on IoT initiatives… all with the best intentions and hopes that they are pursuing the highest-value
 opportunities. Worldwide spending on Internet of Things projects will reach an estimated $772 billion in 2018, up 14.6 percent from 2017, with investment forecast to reach $1.1 trillion in 2021, according to International Data Corp.1
But we think many of these investments will prove to be suboptimal - not because IoT technologies aren't transformative (they are) but rather because its opportunities are so varied and numerous it's hard to know where to begin. And
 many businesses begin in the wrong places.
To turn IoT technologies into a profitable strategic initiative means not only understanding how these systems can transform business models, it also means building a business case that takes best advantage of the technology to deliver
 benefits to a company's customers so both they and the company profit.


The Useful Use Case: Monitoring the Business and the Customer
Executives confronting the question of which IoT opportunities to pursue (and in what order) should start by identifying a broad range of applications and use cases for deploying sensors and collecting data for analysis. With more
 use cases to evaluate, the task becomes rank-ordering which initiatives will generate the greatest business value.
We have found an effective evaluation method classifies IoT use cases into four types:


1. Product monitoring. Aircraft engine manufacturers such as GE and Rolls Royce have been embedding sensors in their products for years to report on their performance. Samsung has introduced a smart refrigerator with internal
 cameras producing images accessible via a smartphone app so that a shopper at the grocery store can see if there's milk in his refrigerator or whether he needs to pick up a half-gallon.2
Value: Product monitoring can create ""servitization"" business models, transforming companies from product sellers to service providers that rent their products while earning continuing revenue from the product and the service.
 For example, a pump manufacturer can offer a zerodowntime guarantee after installing sensors in its equipment to detect problems and fix them before a breakdown occurs.


2. Customer monitoring. Vacationers at the Disney World Resort, in Orlando, Fla., wear ""MagicBand"" bracelets that unlock hotel rooms, pay for food and merchandise and allow guests to gain access to attractions3 (a
 system which represented a reported $1 billion investment4). Similarly, Carnival Corp. has introduced an electronic medallion personalized for cruise ship guests to buy services during their trip.5
Value: Customer monitoring enables firms to gauge interest in their product and service offerings in real-time, shift resources dynamically and quickly in response to shifts in demand, identify ways to enhance
 the customer experience, and offer add-on services.


3. Supply chain monitoring. Embedding digital sensors and cameras in manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations enables companies to track the flow of raw materials, parts and products. Manufacturers of all kinds,
 from pharmaceuticals to automotive parts to food and consumer products, can implement ""track and trace"" projects to identify supply chain problems and opportunities for improvement while mitigating risks and finding cost-savings.
Value: Analysis of IoT generated data brings real-time intelligence to even the most extended and complicated supply chains. In an increasingly globalized world, that data and capability is not a nice-tohave, it is a must-have.


4. Premises monitoring. Retailers and fast-food restaurants increasingly are installing digital sensors and cameras to track their customers' movement and actions to shorten lines and improve their experience. Security firms
 monitor facilities or homes to mitigate risks. Monitoring can also be used for energy optimization in manufacturing, homes, office buildings, and so on.
Value: Analysis of premises data provides insights on space utilization and reveals opportunities for improving traffic flow or capturing customers' attention.
Many initiatives like these have generated big returns. However, if companies keep their IoT initiatives siloed within these four areas, they will be putting the technology (and their businesses) in a straight-jacket. Companies need
 to identify and size the opportunities that bridge those four silos to create larger opportunities.
For example, how could an IoT initiative at an electric utility company connect product, customer, supply chain and premises monitoring? If the utility sells solar power systems to homeowners and businesses, it could combine product
 monitoring, premises monitoring and customer monitoring in combination by:
■  Installing digital sensors in the solar systems to track their energy production (product monitoring)
■  Tracking the production at the location of each solar customer (premises monitoring)
■  Determining difference between solar energy produced and electricity used at individual customer sites (customer monitoring)
■  Predicting how much energy could be sold to other customers on the grid based on analysis of solar energy production and customer consumption patterns.
The IoT devices in this scenario would enable the utility to go far beyond simply metering its services; it would be able to establish (and manage) a cloud-based energy marketplace that enables its customers to sell power to one other,
 creating a closed loop system, and a virtuous (and profitable) circle.
Utilities can create still greater value by combining real-time data from multiple IoT systems to their enterprise systems to produce a connected digital enterprise. This could provide consumers with benchmarks of their energy consumption
 compared to similar consumers, advising them via analytics how to optimize their energy use. This would also allow the utility to plan grid load management proactively and predictively.


How to Tap Even Greater Value from the IoT
When companies build bridges across siloes, and combine those connections with the products of analytics, they can generate new kinds of business value. We have seen companies realize this value in five ways:


1. The customer complexity reducer. By installing sensors in a place of business and connecting them to devices that customers hold, companies can use IoT technologies to remove the friction that customers face when they conduct
 business on a company's premises.
For example, the Amazon Go store that opened in Seattle in 2018 uses digital cameras in the store, artificial intelligence, a smartphone app and other technologies that eliminate the need for cashiers or checkout stations (and checkout
 lines). Customers just pick up the items they want, put them in bags and carry them out. The store's systems track what they remove from shelves and charge their account accordingly.6
Amazon's system combines customer monitoring, product monitoring, and premises monitoring to eliminate transactional friction, improve the customer experience, and differentiate itself in the marketplace - a powerful strategy.


2. The operations enhancer. By monitoring supply chains and tracking onpremise events, companies can identify (and eliminate) costly inefficiencies while preventing stockouts or shutdowns that can lead to lost revenue.
For example, oil refineries that depend upon consistent up-time save millions by combining supply chain with premises surveillance to avoid shutdowns. The same business value principle applies to factories that can track incoming
 supplies and outgoing products while monitoring their warehouses.


3. The product differentiator. By tracking the performance of a product in real time after a customer purchases it, a manufacturer can do predictive maintenance and also offer add-on services.
For example, the company offers a performance guarantee for the product because it has real-time tracking data for it and can offer other performance-related services (such as free product optimization service) that help customers
 get better value. The arrangement also enables a manufacturer to differentiate its product from others in the marketplace, as Tesla has done with its streaming upgrades offered on a tiered subscription basis.7 This combines product monitoring with
 customer usage monitoring, enabled by analytics.


4. The servitization enabler. A growing number of manufacturers are selling connected products and thus making it possible to turn those products into services, generating recurring revenue from products that are rented rather
 than marginal profit from items sold. GE and Rolls Royce are doing this with aircraft engines: selling power by the hour to some customers. Michelin is doing it with truck tires: renting its tires by the mile driven.8 Kaeser Kompressoren, a century-old
 machinery manufacturer based in Coburg, Germany, sells air compressors as a service using IoT after developing a predictive maintenance program for its machines.9
As the compressor illustration suggests, data analytics is central to the servitization model that combines product performance and customer usage monitoring. A manufacturer can install sensors in its products, and monitor customer
 use, but without quality analytics to gain real-time intelligence into performance - to close the loop with the customer - the service is likely to flounder.


5. The data monetizer By capturing data, and analyzing customer usage patterns, companies can look to sell it to third parties (abiding by terms of service agreements with customers).

The data monetizer also can be an internally focused business model. For example, a manufacturer of power generation equipment, or an electrical utility that demonstrates superior efficiencies, could sell data it compiles about its performance to other utilities
 looking for lessons on optimizing their own operations.
Determining Your IoT Opportunities
We recommend executives create their IoT opportunity roadmap by following these four steps that narrow the wide range of options to those that will have the best chance to deliver meaningful returns.


1. Identify relevant use cases. Examine business operations: from supply chain to sales to after-sale service. Look at the kinds of products the company sells: whether they have sensors in them now, whether they can
 be so equipped, whether customers' smartphones represent existing or untapped connections. Take inventory of the company's data analytics capabilities: the kinds of data it collects and the gaps that may exist; how well the company uses analytics now and whether
 its capabilities can be improved.
After examining these criteria with all five IoT opportunity areas in mind, make a list of potential areas where IoT could deliver value.


2. Estimate the costs and benefits of each option. This step should include research with business stakeholders (including customers) to corroborate the use case details. Test original assumptions. Specify
 investments required for each use case. Estimate the returns on each investment.


3. Prioritize the list of opportunities based on clear criteria. For each potential initiative, specify the ROI, the risks involved, estimated time to completion, the feasibility of the project (both technical and cultural)
 and any other factors that business stakeholders identify.


4. Determine the key requirements for executing each initiative. This includes not only the data required to make the initiative a reality but also the latency of that data - how close to ""real-time"" the data must be
 for the use case to be profitable. For example, if the latency required is low, a company will need to have the capabilities to provide near-real-time data to analyze a product's performance, or a customer's use of a product.
Other factors include the skills needed to design, test, implement and refine the system; the technologies needed (such as the sensors, applications, analytics and IoT architecture to support the initiative), and training that employees
 (or customers) will require.
Executives going through this checklist would be wise to pay special attention to their current analytics capabilities. Like any initiative involving analytics, a successful IoT program will require strong data management processes.
 Common data access roadblocks that must be overcome include missing data, data locked up in old infrastructures and proprietary systems, as well as unusable unstructured data. Of course, companies must ensure the security of data they include in IoT systems.
Channeling Ideas In Profitable Directions
Companies don't fail with IoT because they lack ideas; they fail when they pursue too many initiatives in an uncoordinated way so that the highest-value opportunities do not get the appropriate resources. This problem is exacerbated
 when data is siloed, hampering the organization's ability to marshal all its resources to move IoT innovations beyond the proof-of-concept stage.
Companies need an IoT business strategy that determines which of the five business values of IoT makes most sense to them: customer complexity reducer, operations enhancer, product differentiator, servitization enabler and/or data
 monetizer. One only hits the bullseye if that's all one sees, and all one aims at.

76,"The launch was supposed to spur excitement. A large bank redesigned its personal banking web pages to attract new customers and generate more business from existing customers. Instead, the revamped website was an embarrassment. Pages
 loaded slowly for customers using the Chrome web browser. Website traffic dipped to a record low. Instead of elevating the customer experience, the redesign damaged the bank's reputation and brand.
When a customer interacts with a digital product or service, she is not thinking about using a tool: touching a smartphone, clicking a keyboard or swiping a tablet screen. She is buying products and services, or getting information.
 A single hiccup in the process - a touch, click or swipe that fails to yield the expected result - quickly becomes a reason not to proceed.

Executives in charge of developing and presenting these digital customer experiences must make these processes seamless. They must deliver great quality service every time, reliably, whether the customer is using a mobile phone, laptop
 or desktop computer, smart speaker or digital device. The experience must do the job as designed and deliver results quickly.

Ensuring that requires thinking differently about engineering the digital experience. Quality engineering, an approach that relies on agile, DevOps and processes that automate the quality assurance process, enables companies to ensure
 that customer experiences on websites and apps perform right the first time. 
In other words, quality engineering is a catalyst for enhanced CX.



The Growing Challenge of Customer Expectations
The bank's website disaster was not atypical. Many organizations are not providing the digital experiences their customers expect. Sixty-nine percent of customer experiences in the U.S. in 2017 were just ""OK"" according to a 2017 Forrester
 Research study of 118,992 online consumers interacting with 314 brands in 21 industries.1 In that study, consumers ranked 17% of their experiences good and only 1% as excellent. Nearly one out of four (23%) were rated poor or very poor.

A delay in website response can be fatal to customer experience improvements. Researchers at Google found it takes about 15 seconds to load a typical mobile web page on a smartphone. That may sound slow, but it is worse than slow
 in consumers' minds; many will leave a mobile website long before that.2 Average mobile website loading speeds for U.S.-based firms vary by industry. Health care firms were best at 5.4 seconds while technology firms posted times of 6.7 seconds.3
 That's not good enough. All are at risk of losing their users. 
Security is also crucial to creating a quality customer experience. Not enough firms are validating the security of their customer-facing applications. Some 44% of professionals who develop customer experience applications said their
 firms had not taken steps to guard against hacking of their mobile or IoT applications, according to a Ponemon Institute survey of IT and application security practitioners.4 In the same survey, 11% said their organization's mobile apps had been
 breached. Many organizations treat security as an afterthought: 58% said their organization typically waits until their systems are in production to test the security of IoT applications, while 39% said they usually wait until production to test mobile application
 security. 
Another notable characteristic of top-performing customer experiences: They account for those who may have a vision or hearing impairment or other physical or intellectual challenge. Organizations that do not accommodate these users
 increasingly risk being sued for discrimination. In the United States, there have been more than 240 lawsuits against companies in retail, hospitality and financial services industries alleging violations of laws protecting those who have physical and intellectual
 challenges.5 
In the world of digital experiences, things are not likely to get easier. Customer expectations continue to rise as they embrace the latest mobile apps that use automated technologies and artificial intelligence. These digital experiences
 raise everyone's expectations. And even if a digital application doesn't incorporate the latest technologies, customers expect the systems to work just like their smartphones - simply, easily. And they expect their digital experiences will be private and secure.

Companies are betting their futures on their ability to develop new, enticing and sticky digital interfaces on time, without glitches in functionality or performance. They are continuously launching new systems and updating existing
 customer channels. Websites must cater to different browsers. Mobile apps must appear on different smartphone platforms. Voice-activated products - like Amazon Alexa and Google Home - need to be sophisticated at recognizing and answering voice commands. Interfaces
 need to be embedded in devices and appliances in customer homes, businesses, cars and all the other locations where they live, work and play.

These many avenues for access generate complexity. And when one considers that each channel must handle multiple systems (e.g., various iPhone and Android versions) complexity increases, and avenues to failure proliferate.

To overcome these hurdles, companies must go beyond quality assurance to what we call quality engineering. Delivering an enhanced customer experience through the quality engineering route enables an enterprise to meet three key imperatives:

1. Taking an automation first approach across the whole engineering value chain.

2. Centering the quality engineering approach around the customer experience.

3. Creating an efficient tools strategy for the test environment to further automation that improves the customer experience.

The barriers to achieving these requirements lie in the shortcomings of today's quality assurance approaches.


The Problem with Traditional Quality Assurance
Traditionally, companies set up processes for quality assurance teams to test their customer-facing applications. These processes were appropriate when they were first developed but in today's rapid development environment these quality
 assurance processes take too long to get results. What's more, they often fail to catch system compatibility glitches that derail the experiences of entire customer groups. Traditional approaches typically focus only on parts of a customer experience, rather
 the end-to-end process. (Think of a retailer whose omnichannel experience includes in-store, online and mobile.) Traditional quality assurance approaches also can fail to account for the interactions among different applications and services, both existing
 and new, and whether they are compatible with or disruptive to the customer experience, or how the customer experience in one channel relates to all the other channels a company uses. And while some organizations have benefited simply by executing tests earlier
 in the development lifecycle (an adjustment called ""shift left""), the larger quality challenges remain unaddressed.

Quality engineering takes a different direction. 
Quality Engineering: Enhancing the CX
Quality engineering is a superior method for ensuring that customer experiences on websites and mobile apps perform right the first time and every time. The approach recognizes that as enterprise applications (including those connected
 to new apps and customer-facing systems) continue to grow in complexity, companies need a cost-effective, tool-agnostic platform that can orchestrate software releases. Quality engineering enables the adoption of agile and DevOps development approaches. These
 approaches enable an organization to design, develop, test and deliver applications rapidly, repeatedly and with tools and technologies that automate the quality assurance process holistically.

Quality engineering starts with establishing holistic automation processes that embrace a customer-centric mindset in every application design choice and software programming decision. This means procedures measure customer experience
 performance according to such considerations as: 
■  How the system operates, and whether it performs according to expectations (such as speed and reliability)
■  How the customer experiences its performance
■  How a specific feature or design fits into the entire customer experience relative to a company's other offerings
■  How a specific feature or design relates to the customer's life and work experience
Before using a quality engineering approach, companies first should compare their CX to industry best practices and determine how to address the weaknesses they find. They should ask what stands in the way of increasing speed-to-market
 for new and superior customer experiences. Answers to these questions will help them focus a quality engineering program on such elements as:

■  CX quality evaluation to assess and remediate enterprise applications that serve customers, correlating results with key process indicators
■  Technology infrastructure that supports automated systems testing and assesses how CX services perform with a wide range of customer devices, browsers and operating systems
■  Testing for security and regulatory compliance including the safety of personal information and meeting rules related to privacy and differently-able user access
■  Ease-of-use testing with a focus on end-to-end customer journeys through channels such as a mobile apps, mobile websites or websites accessed from a desktop computer
■  Testing for best-in-class performance to measure response times for user clicks and transactions, benchmarked against top performers
Recent AI advances are vital in quality engineering programs, enabling companies to evaluate large systems with numerous potential errors and flaws rapidly. AI-enabled tools can analyze and test customer experience systems much faster
 than conventional ones and quickly zero in on problems. The approach is designed to include new factors as they come online - whether they be chatbots, new social network connections and more - to ensure these functions work for customers as intended.



How to Get Quality Engineering Right
In our experience, a holistic quality engineering program must address an array of issues - including the deployment of agile approaches and DevOps to automate much of the work and improve its effectiveness - before
 it can be implemented successfully. Quality engineering covers five dimensions: 


1. Compatibility tests ensure an application runs uniformly across all digital mediums. For example, a life insurance policy quote can be started on a tablet and completed seamlessly on a mobile phone.


2. Usability testing addresses quantitative validations like task times, error rates (compared to industry standards) and guidelines on such aspects as human-computer interaction—addressing navigation, presentation,
 content and interaction. (Are the changes between web pages logical and easy for a customer to follow? Does the customer get the information he requested?) Usability also covers visual consistency across screens. For example, an online retailer planning for
 peak activity during a Black Friday sale must ensure its digital channels are providing fast, seamless navigation among different web pages, precise content in response customer requests and auto fill capabilities on payment forms to speed the purchase and
 check-out process. 


3. Accessibility testing ensures ""inclusive"" assurance. It verifies digital assets against the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. For example, a mobile banking app should be built
 with accessibility features like alternative text (that describe objects that appear on a screen), good contrast ratios and visible focus indicators (that enable a customer to use a keyboard instead of a mouse to access links, search boxes and other features).



4. Performance testing examines the fluidity of user experiences such as search, comparing alternatives offerings, as well as the ability to select, order, schedule delivery and pay instantaneously. Different
 channels such as mobile and web require their own testing. For example, a retailer planning for a large online sale tied to an event needs best-inclass response times and load times for its channels to prevent crashes during peak demand.



5. Security testing examines the fluidity of user experiences such as search, comparing alternatives offerings, as well as the ability to select, order, schedule delivery and pay instantaneously. Different channels
 such as mobile and web require their own testing. For example, a retailer planning for a large online sale tied to an event needs best-inclass response times and load times for its channels to prevent crashes during peak demand.



What Great Quality Engineering Looks Like
When you look behind the scenes of organizations that have successfully implemented quality engineering programs and processes, you see the problems that did not make it out into the world. These organizations caught these flaws and
 fumbles before they reached customers, both internal and external. The examples below quantify the problems and risks avoided through quality engineering.

Repairing customized systems before launch (not after).
Situation: A New York-based media and information company was customizing its Salesforce application to serve as both a CRM and an ERP system for planning, forecasting and financial management.

Quality engineering impact: Testing processes identified flaws before the company implemented the system. Problems uncovered included:

■  Accessibility: Quality engineering impac 4,908 defects across 25 web pages tested on four browsers.
■  Usability: Quality engineering impac 250 defects identified across seven major task screens
■  Browser compatibility: Quality engineering impac 25 URLs with different content when viewed with four different browsers
Result: An improved customer experience for the media company's users. The company adopted techniques like automated cross-browser testing to correct these issues before moving the system into production, saving time and money.
Testing improves the product performance before customers see it live.
Situation: In preparation for the pilot launch of a new financial product, a U.S.-based insurance and financial services company needed to test elements that went into creating the product, including the web application, critical
 infrastructure and middleware.
Quality engineering impact: The testing process identified flaws the company addressed, which reduced security risks and enabled it to meet web accessibility standards.
Result: By identifying flaws pre-launch, the company reduced its information security costs by 60%. And by identifying browser compatibility and accessibility issues, the firm corrected those issues before launch, saving time
 and money.
Quality Engineering: The Way to Meet Evolving Customer Expectations
Customers will not wait for companies, even well-known brands, to fix a problem. They will move to another provider or vendor.
A quality engineering approach to testing applications and services before customers experience them is a proven path to designing superior digital experiences.
Customers won't wait for quality. And neither should you.

How Leading CMOs are Using Digital Technology to Personalize Communications and Boost ROI Throughout the Customer Lifecycle
Announcing the TCS 2019 Chief Marketing Officer Study
Today's chief marketing officers are under pressure to improve performance with smaller budgets. In the United States, marketing spending as a percentage of revenue across B2C and B2B firms fell over the last five years, shortening
 the tenure for CMOs among their peers in the C-suite.
This changing climate for CMOs is being driven by digital technologies, and TCS is taking an in-depth look at the CMO in the digital age with the TCS 2019 Chief Marketing Study. Our goal is to understand how leading companies are
 using digital technology to dramatically improve the customer brand experience and increase revenue and retention.
Ultimately, we want to help CMOs at large companies better understand how the most successful marketing functions are harnessing digital technologies to increase revenue, profitability and customer value.
From our work with CMOs at many of the world's biggest companies, it's clear that this research couldn't come at a better time.
Our study has been in the research design and planning phase for months so that we can bring new and important insights to the market. In this essay, we give CMOs a sneak preview of the issues that TCS will be shedding light on this
 spring when we bring our findings to the market. We predict our research will show many prevailing beliefs about best marketing practices in the digital realm are no longer relevant.
Digital Everywhere
The stark reality for CMOs today is this: Digital technology is now at the core of marketing, and many – but not all – once-sacrosanct marketing practices are being questioned.
The demands of the CMO role have also increased sharply because digital technology now permeates nearly every aspect of what marketing departments do. Even the creative side of marketing is increasingly influenced by digital technology.
 For example, artificial intelligence technologies are used increasingly to help marketers ferret crucial real-time insights and analytics about customer needs, wants and behaviors.
Many traditional marketing investments are now impediments to attracting and retaining profitable customers, including the following:
■ Marketing budgets spent simply to create awareness of an organization's products and services
■ Campaigns personalizing communications at the segment (rather than the individual) level
■ Boundaries separating marketers from sales and post-sale service
What the TCS 2019 CMO Study Will Explore
One major issue our study will look at is how the marketing functions of 500 CMOs in North America (U.S. and Canada) and Europe (UK, Germany, and The Netherlands) are using digital technologies to personalize communications to prospective
 and actual customers – all, of course, in the hope of converting prospects to customers, and new customers to loyal customers. We will look at consumer marketers (B2C), business marketers (B2B), and business to business to consumer marketers (B2B2C companies
 that sell products and services to wholesalers and retailers before they end up in consumers' hands).
We will look at the communications activities of such B2C, B2B and B2B2C companies in four generic stages of the customer lifecycle – stages that apply to all companies, product and service alike:
■ Awareness creation
■ Purchase influence and decision
■ Post-sale customer support (including contact center and social media responses)
■ Repeat and new purchases by current customers (i.e., retained customers).

Here are a few of the many important issues that we will shed light on:
On the New and Evolving Digital Brand Experience
■ What communications channels are companies favoring in each of the four stages, and do they differ by industry, product and service type or other factors?
■ How are companies personalizing their communications in these stages, and what data and tools are they using to do so?
■ Does use more channels and having more data lead to better personalization? And does better personalization lead to better conversions, lower customer churn, and greater repeat purchases and profitability?
■ What metrics are marketers using to gauge their performance? How accurate are those metrics?
■ To what degree are marketing functions involved in creating communications across all four generic stages in the customer experience? (For example, are communications in post-sale customer service off-limits to most marketing functions?)
On Marketing's Work with Other Customer – and Non-Customer Facing Functions
■ Marketing functions increasingly are sitting on powerful data about customers and their purchasing behaviors want and needs. But to what degree are marketers supplying data and insights to sales, customer service, R&D and IT? And are these other functions
 actually using and getting value from the data?
On What Skills Marketing Functions Need Today
■ What skills are important, and where are some of the biggest skill gaps?
On Automating and Technology in Marketing
■ How much of marketing's activities are automated today? How do CMOs expect this change in the near future? In short, how much marketing activity do CMOs believe can be automated vs. done manually in the ways they have always been done?
■ How complex has the average CMO's “marketing stack” of technologies become? (One estimate is that there are nearly 7,000 marketing software packages from more than 6,000 companies on the market today.) Has a big stack of marketing technologies become an
 asset or a liability to marketing innovation?
■ How are CMOs using analytics in each stage? Are they using it in one stage more than the others? And are they using analytics to understand the behavior of every customer across his or her lifecycle as a customer?
What the Most Successful Digital Marketers Do Differently
■ How do the most and least effective marketing organizations differ on the topics previously mentioned? In particular, how do they differ in how they personalize communications with customers and with what data and using what channels? And how much are
 marketers reaching out beyond their traditional “awareness creation” role to playing a crucial role in sales, customer service, and product enhancement and development
■ Do companies differ in how they approach consumer privacy and sharing data?
These are just a few of the issues we'll be exploring in this exciting and important research.
Next Steps: Stay Tuned to This Digital Channel
Over the next few months, we will be collecting input and analyzing data, and we'll provide regular insights on the issues above in several formats. We believe these insights will shed significant light for CMOs everywhere who want
 to launch more successful marketing campaigns, tie marketing to revenue, help their companies gain market share, and help continue marketing's path in becoming a crucial resource for their organization's sales, customer service, product development, finance
 and IT functions.

Objective
The TCS 2019 Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Study documents how the most- and the least-successful CMOs in North America and Europe are leveraging digital technologies to personalize the customer experience.

Methodology
We surveyed and interviewed more than 500 CMOs to uncover how the top performers or ""leaders"" and the less-effective ""followers"" use, and plan to use, digital technologies in multiple communications channels in four common stages
 of the customer lifecycle (awareness, conversion, support and retention) to increase revenue, profitability and value to customers and prospects.

Survey population
These global companies were a mix of B2C (60%), B2B (27%), B2B2C (5%), with a mix of B2B and B2C (8%). The average annual revenue of those surveyed was $10.6 billion; the median was $7.0 billion. The average annual marketing budget
 was $392 million; the median was $272 million. 
Digital Marketing Trends
The way that large companies are marketing their brands and offerings is in a state of digital metamorphosis. Mass marketing through analog channels (especially broadcast and print media) is still happening, but digital channels are
 dominating. Companies in the digital marketing ecosystem (especially Facebook, Google and Amazon) have unprecedented, granular information on consumers and businesses. They and wireless communications providers know where these customers are. And artificial
 intelligence-infused analytics and other marketing technologies give companies powerful tools to identify potential customers and the ability to tailor messages that turn prospects into customers that buy and keep on buying.

Yet our research is finding that when it comes to using digital personalization technologies effectively, most large marketing organizations that we surveyed are not where they need to be. Only a minority is using digital technologies
 to personalize communications at every stage of the brand experience/customer life cycle, although businessto-consumer (B2C) companies are more proficient than business-to-business (B2B) companies. Most are not taking advantage of the customer data available
 to them. The study research indicates that the majority of CMOs anticipate migration to the cloud (for on-premises and off-premises) and a dramatic increase in the use of automation by 2020 across every marketing activity.


Survey Findings At a Glance

■ 52% of the firms who digitally personalize communications during the support stage are leveraging the data around their customers' previous buying behavior.
■ Only 24% of those using customer data at the support stage take advantage of geo-location data; only 40% leverage data from social media behavior, only 22% exploit customer product usage data (from sensors embedded in their products); only 14% use customer
 service usage data from company IoT sensors. 
■ 68% of marketers use digital technologies to personalize communications in the support stage by providing order status information.

4. How leaders differ from followers

■ Only 26% of followers are likely to use analytics in the support stage. 
■ 54% of leaders are more likely to use analytics in the customer retention stage.
■ Leaders: 16% (of total sample) indicated a much higher than average impact from their marketing investments in one or more of six metrics (return on marketing investment, revenue by campaign, impact on sales and lifetime customer value, customer retention
 and conversion rate), and that their metrics were accurate.
■ Followers: 18% (of total sample) performed poorly on some or all of the six metrics, or didn't use those metrics, or did use some or all of them but couldn't vouch for their accuracy.

5. CMO predictions
■ 68% predict that by 2020 digital personalization of communications will be more important for attracting new customers than for keeping and cross-selling to existing customers.

■ But 42% of leaders vs 20% of followers believe that in 2020 digitally personalized communications will be most important for current customers in the support and retention stages.
■ 94% of all marketers expect automation for data and analytics solutions to increase by 2020 compared with 73% automated today.

■ Marketing activities are becoming heavily automated and shifting to public/private clouds.
Overview

Chief marketing officers in large North American and European companies are under pressure to improve their function's performance such as return on investment (especially in digital technologies), campaign effectiveness, and customer engagement and retention
 throughout the entire brand experience.
Using digital technology effectively to personalize how a company communicates with customers, both before and after the purchase, is going to be essential for the highperforming marketing organization. Current (and future) technologies such as network operations
 (including mobile), analytics, cloud-based content and customer experience platforms, digital ad buying systems, automation, and AI give companies an enormous opportunity to tailor communications based on a person's or firm's demographics, location, past buying
 behavior and other data. 
Identifying prospects who are ready to buy, personalizing the offers, customizing ongoing post-sale communications, and suggesting new products are going to be key to creating a consistent brand experience that delights the customer in today's highly competitive
 marketplace-and all are within marketers' grasp. But getting value from such marketing investments is not easy. Nor is measuring that value with confidence.

The 2019 CMO Study was created to explore these challenges, including how marketing organizations in large companies ($500 million in revenue or more) are using digital technologies to personalize communications with prospects and customers.
Specifically, the survey was designed to get answers to the following questions:
■ How many companies are digitally personalizing their communications, and in what stages of the brand experience or customer lifecycle?
■ What channels and data are they using most frequently to personalize such communications? And how they personalizing those communications?

■ What do the most effective marketers do differently than the trailing marketers in personalized communications? Do they emphasize certain phases of the brand experience? Certain communications channels over others? Certain types of data? Use analytics
 and AI more heavily (or less heavily)? 
We also wanted to understand ""best practices"" in these companies by determining how leading marketers differed from trailing marketers in using digital technologies to personalize communications. To do that, we compared the survey responses of two groups
 (""Leaders"" and ""Followers""), determining those groups based on their answers to questions about the metrics they used, how they fared on them, and how accurate they thought their metrics were.
Here is a preview of the initial findings for all 516 surveys, which focused on four stages of the customer lifecycle (awareness, conversion, support, and retention) including for B2C (which includes B2B2C) and B2B companies, and for leaders and followers.
This report shares initial findings for our survey of more than 500 B2B and B2C enterprise CMOs in North America and Europe across every major industry. The results are focused on four common stages of the customer journey: awareness, conversion, support,
 and retention.
Initial Key Findings


Most marketing functions are not creating content for all four stages of the customer life cycle
To create the optimal brand experience, marketing departments should be involved in all four phases of the customer life cycle. However, when it comes to customer communications, this is not the case. As you can see in figure 1, all marketing organizations
 are playing equally in the awareness stage, with most also playing in the conversion stage. But across all surveys, less than half are (37%) are creating communications for customers in the support stage, with 47% doing so in the customer retention stage,
 particularly in B2B companies. 

How leaders differ from followers: Leaders' marketing departments are more likely than those in followers to create communications for prospects and customers in Stages 2, 3 and 4.
■ Stage 2 (conversion): 73% of leaders do so vs. 69% of followers 
■ Stage 3 (support): 44% of leaders vs. 34% of followers 
■ Stage 4 (retention): 56% of leaders vs. 39% of followers 
The findings from the survey population as a whole are based on the subset of marketing functions that personalize communications in each of the four stages.


In the awareness stage, marketers use digital channels most frequently and personalize communications based on demographics more than other types of data.
Every CMO surveyed said their marketing organization was involved in creating content to make its target market aware of its brand and products/services. This is no surprise; it's the traditional role of marketing.

At least 90% of marketers use the following channels to communicate to their marketplaces: company website, online video sites, email, digital media ads (including paid search engine ads), field outlets (stores, branches, field offices). However, they still
 frequently use nondigital channels such as print media (89%), broadcast advertising (75%), and telemarketing (84%). This suggests that non-digital marketing channels are still very much part of the CMO toolkit.

The most commonly used data to personalize those communications by far is demographic information, used by nearly four out of five companies surveyed (78%). The second most frequently used data for personalized communications is web traffic data (e.g., from
 using cookies on a web browser), used by 48%, followed by using data on buying behavior obtained from other companies (47% use this data).

In Stage 1, only about 4 in 10 companies use geo-location data based on the physical proximity of people to a company's place of business (from digital devices such as smartphones). However, the percentage is much higher for B2C companies (at 52%) than for
 B2B companies (only 1%). 
Based on the data they have, how are marketing functions personalizing communications? The two most frequently cited ways were to provide useful product/service information (71% are doing this) and give special offers and pricing (66%).

However, leading marketers (86%) are far more likely than followers (59%) to personalize communications with useful product/service information.




Most marketers involved in the conversion stage use digital data and digital channels to personalize communications to influence buying decisions
Again, nearly three-quarters of the marketers surveyed (72%) get involved in personalizing communications in Stage 2 (traditionally the domain of sales organizations, especially in B2B companies). In fact, 81% of the B2C marketing heads we surveyed said
 marketing played a role in this stage of the customer lifecycle, while less than half (49%) of B2B company marketing heads said the same thing.

For those marketers who are involved in personalizing marketing in Stage 2, their most frequently used channels are both digital and non-digital. In digital channels, more than 90% of this group uses digital media ads, their firm's website, email marketing,
 and online video site. But more than 90% also use print media advertising and field outlets (Figure 3).

But what channels are most companies no longer using to convert prospects to customers today? Only 7% are using direct mail, and only about one in four uses a field sales force (27%), although 68% of B2B companies still rely on them. In terms of data to
 personalize communications, marketers (78%) use demographic data more than any other type. However, 44% of marketers today are using prospects' geo-location data to tailor communications-although nearly all of this is from B2C companies (54%) than B2B companies
 (only 1%). 
As in Stage 2, the majority personalizes communications with useful information on their products/services and special deals and prices. A minority tailors the graphic design of their communication or with relevant videos. Only 1% use technology to show
 what their company's offerings would look like in the prospects' environment (e.g., furniture in a living room, clothes on a person, etc.). This is not surprising because many companies are not likely to have enough information on a prospect to show how their
 products would look in the customer's environment. 



Most marketers involved in post-sale support personalize customer communications through their company website and email

As stated previously, only 37% of the marketing heads surveyed said their departments use digital technology to personalize content in Stage 3 (post-sale customer support). But those that do far more frequently use their firm's websites (97%) and email support
 center (97%) to do this. Less than half create personalized communications that is distributed through their company's mobile apps (48%). A higher percentage of marketing departments personalize communications to be used by people in field outlets (84%), contact
 centers (65%), the firm's social media pages (68%), and in responses to social media comments (58%). (See Figure 4.)

Marketers that digitally personalize communications in post-sale support have more relevant customer data they can use, and many use it. More than any other type of data, about half of these companies (52%) use customers' previous buying behavior with their
 firm. Yet much other data is still rarely being tapped here, including geo-location data (used by only 24%), customer social media behavior (40%), customer product usage data (from sensors embedded in their products (22%) or customer service usage data (14%)
 from sensors in the places in which they do business with customers. 
The most common way that marketers use digital technologies to personalize communications for customers in post-sale support is provide order status information (done by 68% of marketers). More than half (55%) of marketers provide relevant product/service
 information. Leaders are more than twice as likely than followers to provide such personalized information on their products/services.




Marketers involved in the customer retention stage use digital ads and their company website to personalize messages

A higher percentage of the marketers (47%) create content in Stage 4 than they do in Stage 3 (37%). Their communications in Stage 4 are to trigger repeat purchases or new purchases (from cross-selling and upselling). The marketing functions of consumer companies
 (both B2C and B2B2C) lead the way here. It appears that in B2B companies, the sales function controls customer communications. Only 19% of the B2B companies surveyed said marketing is involved in digitally personalizing communications with customers after
 those prospects become customers. 
This is in stark contrast to most consumer companies, in which the majority of CMOs surveyed (57% in B2C) said marketing plays a role in creating communications for existing customers (in the hope of getting them to buy more products and services). This
 was also a key way that marketing leaders (B2C, B2B and B2B2C) were different than followers; 56% of leaders digitally personalize communications for customers in Stage 4. Only 39% of followers do so. Marketers that digitally personalize customer communications
 in this stage most frequently use two channels: digital media ads (used by 100%) and their website (100%). (See Figure 5.) The data they most commonly use is customers' previous buying behavior with their firm (74% use this) and demographic data (72% use this).
 However, only about one in four (24%) are using geolocation data to personalize communications. The digital leaders in marketing are more likely to use such customer proximity data-31% of them do it vs. 24% for followers- but it's not much higher than average.
 And only 38% of marketers that digitally personalize communications in Stage 4 use customer web traffic data. An even smaller percentage (28%) uses customer social media data.

So how do they digitally personalize such communications? The most common ways are to provide relevant information on the product/service, recommend other offerings based on customer's purchasing behavior, and offer special deals and prices.




By 2020, CMOs expect that digital personalization of communications will be most important in attracting new customers, not nurturing existing customers

By next year, more than two-thirds of CMOs (68%) predicted that digitally personalized communications will be more important in getting new customers (Stages 1 and 2) than in keeping and selling more to present customers (Stages 3 and 4). (See Figure 6.)

Only a third said the most important place for digitally personalized communications was Stage 3 (9% said this) or Stage 4 (23%).

However, leaders and followers answered this question very differently. More than twice as many leaders as followers (42% vs. 20%) believe that in 2020 digitally personalized communications would be most important in Stages 3 or 4 of the brand experience-
 that is, in creating messages for current customers, not trying to attract new ones.

Leaders and followers have a fundamental difference in personalizing pitches to prospects: Leaders don't focus on prices; followers do. For those that said Stage 1 will be the most important one to personalize communications in 2020, only 24% of leaders
 said it was in tailoring offers and prices. Many more leaders (43%) said it was in providing useful product/service information. In contrast, 51% of followers said it was tailoring offers and prices, and only 30% said tailoring product/service information
 (excluding prices).


Analytics are used most often to convert prospects to customers, but far less often to retain customers
A surprisingly low percentage of companies use analytics software to understand customer behavior in three of the four stages of the customer lifecycle (Stages 1, 2 and 3)-but especially in Stages 3 and 4, when those companies likely have an abundance of
 digital information on their interactions with customers. (See Figure 7).

However, leaders more than followers use analytics to understand customer behavior in all four stages (Figure 8).

Still, the use of analytics to track prospects and customers in each of the four stages as well as throughout their lifecycle is the exception rather than the rule. Only about one in six (17%) of our survey respondents do that.


Marketing activities are becoming heavily automated and shifting to public/private clouds
To personalize thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of marketing messages to prospects and customers throughout the brand experience, companies need to automate extensively. Any time a marketing person is needed to shift channels, analyze which
 ones are working, change graphic formats, tweak messages (including tailoring offers), those marketing campaigns will slow down. Put simply, for CMOs to move to a world of marketing campaigns that self-adjusts in real time to their channels, offers, copy,
 graphics and other elements of personalization, those marketing activities must be automated with artificial intelligence and other ""intelligent"" technologies.

The survey results suggest that most CMOs feel the same way. We asked our 516 survey participants questions about the degree to which their marketing activities in five core areas were automated today.

■ Content and customer experience (including content marketing and social media management platforms, content creation tools, etc.)

■ Advertising (including ad verification, native or social advertising platforms)

■ Direct marketing management (e.g., email marketing platforms, lead management platforms)

■ Web operations (e.g., personalization platforms, search engine marketing/optimization)

■ Data and analytics solutions (e.g., digital marketing analytics tools, marketing campaign dashboards)

The following numbers track the percentage of CMOs that said the activities were totally or mostly manual vs. those who said totally or mostly automated in those five technology domains. In short, there's already a fairly high degree on average of automation.
 (See Figure 9.)

We also asked them to predict the extent to which those activities would be automated by 2020. The short answer: CMOs expect to increase automation significantly over the next year. (See Figure 10.)

But the aggressive drive to personalize content to ever-higher degrees throughout the customer lifecycle can be seen in other ways. Making real-time, automated, personalized content changes to identify prospects and entice them to buy-or get customers to
 buy more and remain loyal customers-companies need enormous amounts of computing power. As such content becomes more digital-intensive (think digital videos) and as the communications channels increasingly become mobile digital devices (especially on the smartphone),
 CMOs need immense computational resources on demand.
Increasingly, this amount of computing power is beyond the capabilities that most large companies have in their data centers-even some of the largest companies. This is the reason that public, private and hybrid cloud companies that offer infinite computing
 power are growing by leaps and bounds. 
To assess the degree to which marketing software applications and technology infrastructure was running on companies' on-premises data centers vs. those of public and/or private cloud companies), we asked CMOs to roughly estimate those percentages (Figure
 11). About half of their applications and IT infrastructure runs onpremises now. But they estimated that 70% of their marketing technology stack will run in public and/or private clouds by next year.

Conclusion
This is the initial analysis of our extensive research findings. We are continuing to conduct qualitative, best-practice interviews and mining the data to see key differences between leaders and followers, industries, regions and countries, and B2C compared
 with B2B companies. You will see those in-depth reports in the weeks ahead.

Innovating the Brand Experience through Digital Transformation

Chief Marketing Officers have one of the riskiest roles in the C-suite, with most staying in office only 4.1 years on average.1 Diminishing budgets and higher performance expectations are compelling the visionary CMO to
 transform their organizations into high-value marketing engines that deliver an extraordinary brand experience at every stage of the customer journey.

This study shares fresh insights about how more than 500 enterprise CMOs in North America and Europe are creating impactful brand experiences for their audiences using digital technologies, now and in the future, with personalization
 that delivers customized, relevant messages for multichannel marketing campaigns.


Personalizing the Entire Brand Experience 
Our CMO Study results are being released in four condensed reports to reveal how senior marketers currently use, and plan to use, evolving digital technologies to personalize the brand experience at every stage of the customer journey.

Each report highlights what leaders do differently from the followers including:

■ The channels they use (both digital and non-digital), and the innovative ways they use those channels
■ The customer data they collect, and how they use it to personalize communications
■ The proficiency with analytics technologies used to identify prospects and personalize communications
■ The level of automation for key aspects of marketing, how much of that technology is in the cloud, and plans for the future
■ How adept are they at personalizing and up-leveling a dynamic brand experience 

The Big Reveal: Hidden Marketing Opportunities for CMOs

Marketing Functions Creating Communications in Each Stage
■ Stage 1 Awareness: 100%
■ Stage 2 Prospect Conversion: 72%
■ Stage 3 Customer Support: 37%
■ Stage 4 Customer Retention: 47%
■ All stages: 19% of B2B marketers 

Only 19% of B2B marketers create content across every stage of the brand experience.

Most Marketers Limit Their Focus to Awareness 
Most modern marketers state that their organizations are, and should be involved, in the entire brand experience. Our study results reveal that most CMOs act very differently. In fact, all 516 of the CMOs surveyed are involved in their companies' efforts to
 generate awareness of their company's brand, products and services among potential customers-but this participation drops considerably in the subsequent stages.


What Leaders Do Differently
According to interviews with leading CMOs, not creating content across the entire brand experience is a missed opportunity. They contend that marketing must be embedded across all four stages for it to succeed, particularly now that
 consumers with legions of social media followers can have a big impact on a brand's image. At these top-performing companies, more functions are falling under the marketing umbrella.


Marketing Can Lead the Way to Better Business Performance 
""Our marketing team handles pricing, product positioning, collateral production (internal and external), and training and learning…We also have a big influence on new product development.”

#1 Digital Channels Dominate in the Awareness Stage
The study results show that a higher percentage of companies are using four primary digital channels (their company websites, digital media ads, online video sites, and email marketing) to generate initial awareness with target customers
 than are using non-digital channels (including broadcast and print media ads). But, consumer companies still heavily rely on traditional channels such as print and broadcast media advertising.

Leaders and followers are similar in usage of communication channels except for these four:

■ Company's mobile apps
■ Event marketing
■ Digital ads on noncompany e-commerce sites
■ Field sales force 

About 68% of respondents predict that by 2020 digital personalization of communications will be more important for attracting new customers than for keeping and cross-selling to existing customers.

#2 Marketing Leaders Are More Innovative in The Digital Channels They Use
These leaders are most likely to be B2C and B2B2C companies and are nearly five times as likely as B2B firms to run ads on such ecommerce sites (33% vs. 7%).

Mobile apps appear to be important in getting potential customers to become customers. Some 76% of leaders said they use mobile apps to create awareness of their offerings with people who hadn't purchased their products. Only 60%
 of the followers do the same. 

About 40% of leaders advertise on e-commerce sites owned by other companies (like Amazon.com and Walmart.com)-about twice as many as followers (19%).


#3 Traditional Demographic Data Is Still Essential for Personalization but Digital Data Is Gaining Traction

78% of respondents say that demographic data is the most frequently used information to tailor communications in Stage 1, but
50% say that both third-party data and web traffic data are becoming increasingly important to get customized messages in front of prospects.


#4 Data on Physical Proximity of Prospects Is Popular in B2C but Not in B2B

52% of consumer companies personalize communications using geo-location data, the information that marketers can get today from wearable or handheld devices such as smartphones and smartwatches. Across all companies, nearly
 four in 10 is using geo-location data. 

Only 1% of B2B companies use geo-location data to personalize marketing, another untapped opportunity.

#5 Providing Personalized Product and Service Information Is More Important than Offering Special Deals


■ 86% of leaders communicate to prospects by providing useful information about their offerings in the awareness stage (compared to 59% of followers).


■ 68% of leaders also provide special offers and prices in their messages.


■ In contrast, 63% of followers personalize communications primarily through special offers/deals.

By providing a big online audience with useful product information, the founder of Glossier Emily Weiss2 built a future customer base for a company's whose 2018 revenue exceeded $100 million.3

Special Offers vs. Product Information
■ Automakers were more likely than other sectors to provide useful product information
■ Retailers were more likely to personalize deals
■ CPG companies were more likely to provide relevant videos 

Best Practices In Action: How Leaders Keep the Customer Satisfied 
Leading Manufacturer's Digital Marketing Renaissance 
Summary: To revive the brand and boost sales, this recognized manufacturer of solid surface countertops undertook a rebranding and revamped marketing strategy, empowered by digital technology. The rebranding focused on updating
 the product and introducing it to a new generation of customers. The team worked with an ad agency to develop a new brand message, positioning and logo.

Challenge: This company was challenged to reinvigorate its perceived ""low-cost” product to update it to better compete against other countertop manufacturers of popular ""engineered stone” materials (such as quartz countertops),
 who were gaining marketshare. 
Solution: By reformulating the brand and adopting a fresh, new tagline, consumers were inspired to rethink the product's attributes. In addition, the company also rethought their entire digital marketing strategy. A key change
 was reimagining the target audience for its marketing campaigns. In place of print advertising geared toward distributors and fabricators, the company now uses digital channels to target the ultimate decision makers: architects, designers, consumers and building
 owners-key influencers who decide the look, feel and function of the spaces being created.

Outcome: With digital marketing, the company is able to reach new audiences in a way that would have been impossible in the past. In fact, it now buys almost exclusively digital media, where it personalizes each click-through
 according to the potential customer's needs. These include very focused messages in high-traffic sites that key influencers visit. The team has also cultivated about 60 design influencers globally to blog, post on social media and otherwise promote the brand.

Using the viewership data from its website, the company is able to determine which touchpoints-influencers, banners and short videos-are getting the most traction and focus resources on them. This has created an exponential impact
 that ripples globally with a dramatic increase in digital impressions and high-quality sales leads. The result? In the first six months of 2018, the company broke records in selling its product in North America, its biggest market.

About This Research 
This short report is based on just a portion of a 45-question online survey to capture what CMOs do in the awareness stage (Stage 1) in creating communications for prospects and customers. In forthcoming reports, we will publish our
 findings on how the same marketing organizations are using digital technologies to personalize communications in the other three stages (Stage 2 is conversion to customers; Stage 3 is customer support; and Stage 4 is customer retention).

Our first release gave an overview of the initial research findings and the final master report will be released in Fall of 2019 with a comprehensive analysis into the CMO Study results.

The CMOs we surveyed work in: 
■ 11 industries 
■ Companies with at least $500 million in annual revenue, with most in much larger companies

■ Firms with average revenue $10.6 billion and the average annual marketing budget was $392 million
■ About two-thirds (65%) were from consumer companies (both B2C and B2B2C firms), while 27% were from B2B companies
■ The remaining 8% worked in companies with a fairly balanced mix of B2C and B2B end customers

■ 60% work in North America, and 40% work in Europe 
Research Goals & Methodology 
Our research goals were to determine: 
■ How technology-enabled personalized marketing content today is used throughout the brand experience for prospects and customers (in their marketing and sales campaigns, and customer support and retention initiatives)
■ The impact of such personalization and the key factors in making it effective
■ How CMOs and their organizations develop communications across all stages of the customer lifecycle

The research looks in depth at what marketers are doing in each of the four stages: what channels are being used by companies in different industries, different target end customers (consumers vs. organizations), and different countries;
 what data companies are using to personalize communications; how they are personalizing communications based on the data they possess on prospects and customers; and how the most successful marketers differ from the rest in channel usage, data for personalization,
 and types of personalization. 
The study findings, based on a mix of B2C, B2B, and B2B2C, are segmented into key stages of the customer journey and will be released in 4 short reports:

Stage 1 (Creating Awareness): Attracting the Digitally Distracted Prospect

Stage 2 (Prospect Conversion): Personalizing Content to Turn Prospects into Customers

Stage 3 (Customer Support): Interacting Digitally to Become Invaluable Customer Advisers

Stage 4 (Customer Retention): Using Analytics to Predict What Customers Need Next

Master Report: How Leading CMOs Captivate and Convert Customers for Life
This comprehensive report to be release in late 2019 consolidates the findings and provides in-depth analysis and surprising new insights about how leading marketers differ from the rest in the innovative use of digital technologies, data, and analytics to
 personalize the brand experience-within, across and outside all four stages of the customer journey.

 	This report is based on TCS' larger study on digital marketing opportunities for CMOs in 11 global industries. Our findings are based on just one part of the study: how marketers are using digital technology to personalize the way they communicate with prospects in what we refer to as the first stage of the brand experience. (This is the awareness stage, one of four.)
 

Retailers far more frequently than all 516 survey respondents said marketing creates communications in Stage 4 of the brand experience—getting current customers to buy more offerings. About three-quarters of retail marketers do that vs. less than half of all survey participants (47%).


KEY FINDINGS IN STAGE 1—Creating Market Awareness

 	How Retail Marketers Personalize Communications to Attract the Digitally Distracted
 

#1 Digital Channels Dominate, and Social Media is a Key Tool

 	Every retailer creates awareness of its offerings through both digital and non-digital channels (including print media).
So print newspapers and magazines are still key marketing vehicles. Fewer retailers—but still a majority—use broadcast media. And more than two-thirds use their social media presence to reel in prospects.
 

 	Some 100% of the retail CMOs we surveyed use print media advertising to attract the attention of potential customers. That compares with 89% of the survey population as a whole. And 87% of retail marketers advertise in broadcast channels—again, higher than all industries (75%). However, not one retailer uses direct mail marketing.
 

 	But digital channels are crucial. Retailers were much more likely to use their mobile apps to snare the attention of prospective customers. Some 92% of retailers use their apps as a channel for creating awareness vs. 69% of all companies surveyed. Other research confirms the value of retailers' apps. Among several categories of apps that it studied, retail and ecommerce apps enjoyed the highest retention rates of users worldwide in the second half of last year, according to Localytics.1


 	About two-thirds of retailers use their social media pages to get their messages out. Savvy retailers go another step: They use social media to interact online with prospects. For example, U.S. home improvement retail giant Lowes replies to consumers who ask questions on the firm's Facebook pages. And according to one article, they aren't formulaic responses.2 As of April 2019, Lowes had more than 4.5 million Facebook followers.
 

About 92% of retailers use their apps to create awareness vs 69% of all companies surveyed.


 	About one quarter (26%) run digital ads on e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com. That number was the same as the entire survey population.
 

 	This might sound surprising: A retailer running ads on another retailer's e-commerce site? But other research shows it is not unusual. A survey conducted this year found retailers with at least $100 million in online revenue spend an average 14% of their digital ad budgets on Amazon.3


A much higher percentage of retailers (37%) than survey population as a whole (10%) uses ads on online review forums (such as Yelp, Google and others).



#2 Retailers Latch on to Social Media and Geo Location Data

 	Retail marketers are more likely than survey respondents as a whole to use data for personalizing communications to create awareness of their offerings. Most retailers use demographic data, followed by social media behavior, and website traffic data, to personalize their marketing messages.
 

 	Retailers are also much more attentive to using social media behavior to personalize messages. Some 61% of retail marketers use this data vs. 41% for the survey population overall. One reason is that the products retailers sell are highly tangible and can attract consumer attention. For example, Lowes in 2013 began running short videos on the social site Vine about how to fix things around the home.4 The video ads were meant to help consumers believe they can make the repairs, and thus increase the chances of selling products that Lowes sells. “Often people are intimated by home improvement,” the company's CMO at the time told a reporter.5 Lowes extensively uses Facebook, Pinterest and other social media as well.
 



About four out of 10 retailers are using geo-location data to personalize their communications with prospects. This is a crucial piece of data for retailers to use—especially given more and more
consumers are buying products online. That means those who are out and about and are close to a retailer's store become bigger targets.



#3 Retailers More Often Push Useful Info, Not Price

 	The last question we asked retailers on how they personalize marketing in Stage 1 of the brand experience was about the kind of information they provide to prospects, based on the data they have about a potential customer. Surprisingly, more retailers (78%) furnished useful information than hawked special deals and prices (68%).
 

 	How Lowes uses social media – to not only display its products but also to engage online customers – provides testimony to the value of helping consumers online, not just promoting products and services. “Digital gives us ways to connect more deeply with our customers than traditional media ever could,” Lowes CMO Jocelyn Wong said. “We can be there throughout the customer journey, in many different ways and across many different moments. We're able to create more value, more often, and engage on a more personal level.”
 

 	The retailers we surveyed provided additional evidence of the power of digital marketing at the very start of a new customer relationship—when a retail brand is trying to reel in a new customer to its stores.
 

More retailers (78%) provided useful information than special deals and prices (68%).


Demographics

 	TCS surveyed chief marketing officers at 62 retailers in North America and Europe, all of which had annual revenue of at least $500 million. Nearly two-thirds had revenue of $5 billion or more. Average revenue was $9.3 billion. Half the executives work at retailers headquartered in the U.S., and about a quarter are based in the UK.
 

 	We surveyed retailers across more than eight subsegments.

 	This report on marketers in the travel, transportation and hospitality (TTH) industry is based on TCS' larger 2019 study on digital marketing opportunities for CMOs in 11 global industries. The findings of this report are based on just one part of the study: how marketers are using digital technology to personalize the way they communicate with prospects to create awareness, in what we refer to as the first stage of the brand experience. (Creating awareness is one of four stages; stay tuned for more reports about what TTH marketers are doing in the other three stages.) 
 

Not surprisingly, all 41 TTH companies we surveyed have marketing programs in Stage 1. However, when we asked whether marketing creates communications in the other three stages, those percentages fell off significantly. (See figure 1.) 


KEY FINDINGS IN STAGE 1-Creating Market Awareness

 	How TTH Marketers Personalize Communications to Attract the Digitally Distracted
 

#1 Travel Marketers Are Heavily Digital and Heavily Social

 	Every CMO we surveyed in this industry said their company uses four digital marketing channels: digital ads, their own websites, email marketing and online video sites. The clear majority (93%) also has social media site pages-a much higher than average percentage than the 11 industries we surveyed (71% of whose companies created awareness through their social media company pages). Digital media ads today on the big travel book sites are crucial for many companies in this industry. (See figure 2.)
 

 	But non-digital media are still important for the majority of firms: outbound contact centers, field outlets (i.e., travel agencies), field sales forces, billboards, and print advertising.
 

 	However, direct mail marketing (used by none of the firms) and broadcast media (used by only about one third) are not frequently used marketing channels in Stage 1. For all survey respondents, 75% use broadcast media, and so travel, transportation and hospitality firms as a whole rely far less on that marketing channel.
 


#2 Travel Marketers Are Not Fully on the Digital Data Trail for Personalizing Communications

 	So what data do travel-related marketers use to personalize communications to individual prospects? By far, the highest percentage of them use demographic data (which has long been in use, before and after digital channels emerged in the 1990s). Coming in a distant second (used by 41%) is data on online users past buying behavior with other companies. For example, for a rental car company, somebody booking an airline flight is a prime prospect for dangling a rental car deal. (See figure 3.)
 

 	Less than a third are using web traffic to their own websites to personalize what they present to prospects. And only about one in four personalizes communications based on a prospect's social media comments. That is far less than the industry average (41%), and less than half of the retail industry average (61%). Personalizing interactions with consumers on a travel company's social media pages (e.g., Facebook) could be new frontier for many travel marketers who want to turn prospects into customers.
 

 	Only one in five travel industry marketers uses geo- location data to personalize communications in the awareness stage of the brand experience. Such data, which smartphones can provide if wireless carriers sell it travel marketers, on average is used by 38% of the 516 marketers that we surveyed in 11 industries. All to say that travel marketers are trailing most other sectors in using geo-location to target ads.
 

Only 1 in 5 travel industry marketers uses geo-location data to personalize communications in the awareness stage of the brand experience.



#3 Personalized Marketing Usually Means Special Offers

 	People booking travel are often ready to book when they go online. Travel marketers know this, and their marketing messages usually comes armed with deals. The most frequent way that travel marketers digitally personalize communications with individuals to create awareness of their offerings is to pitch special deals and prices. 66% of the travel marketers we survey do this. (See figure 4.)
 

 	Close behind (by 63% of those surveyed) was providing useful product or service information - again, personalized to the individual based on data the travel marketer has about that individual. More than one third (37%) are tailoring the graphic design (colors, images used, etc.) of their personalized digital promotions to prospects. And 29% provide relevant videos to prospects based on some data they have about them - e.g., the web surfer looking for vacation hotels in Paris who is shown a hotelier's digital ad with a video of the premises.
 

The most frequent way that travel marketers digitally personalize communications with individuals to create awareness of their offerings is to pitch special deals and prices. 66% of the travel marketers we survey do this.


Demographics

 	We surveyed 41 companies in North America and Europe in the travel, transportation and hospitality industry. A breakdown of that industry can be seen in Figure 5. Nearly half (49%) the firms were based in the U.S., with 27% based in the UK, 12% in Canada, 7% in Netherlands and 5% in Germany. (See Figure 5.)
 

 	The average revenue of the firms we surveyed was $12.5 billion. Nearly half (49%) had marketing budgets of $250 million or more (Figure 6).

Personalizing the Entire Brand Experience


 	Our CMO Study results are being released in four condensed reports to reveal top 5 insights about how senior marketers currently use, and plan to use, evolving digital technologies to personalize the brand experience at every stage of the customer journey.
 

Stage 1:  Create market awareness
Stage 2:  Convince and convert prospects to clients
Stage 3:  Customer support following purchase
Stage 4:  Customer retention to upsell and cross-sell


 	Each report highlights what leaders do differently from the followers including:
 

■ The channels they use (digital and non-digital), and the innovative ways they use those channels
■ The customer data they collect, and how they use it to personalize communications
■ The proficiency with analytics technologies used to identify prospects and personalize communications
■ The level of automation for key aspects of marketing, how much of that technology is in the cloud, and plans for the future
■ How adept they are at personalizing and up-leveling a dynamic brand experience


The Big Reveal: Marketing's Involvement in the Conversion Stage Varies by Sector


The number of marketers creating communications drops from 100% in Awareness stage to 72% in Conversion stage but varies by sector.


 	In our Stage 1: Awareness report: Attracting the Digitally Distracted Prospect, all 516 chief marketing officers surveyed aid their marketing departments create communications to generate awareness of their company's offerings with potential customers. 
 

 	Consumer-oriented companies were far more active, with about 4 out of 5 of those marketers creating communications compared to half of B2B marketers.
 

Marketing Functions Creating Communications in Each Stage


■ Stage 1  Awareness: 100%
■ Stage 2  Prospect Conversion: 72%
■ Stage 3  Customer Support: 37%
■ Stage 4 Customer Retention: 47%
■ All stages: 19% of B2B marketers



What Leaders Do Differently


88% of leaders compared to 62% of followers personalized their messages in this stage by providing useful product/service information.


 	In the Conversion stage, how communications are personalized appears to differentiate leaders from followers more than what data they use to personalize those messages. More than twice as many leaders (34%) than followers (14%) provide videos that are relevant.
 

 	The following shows the percentages and industry segments of those companies using data to convert potential customers with timely personalized offers: 
 

■ 70% of the insurance, retail and CPG companies
■ 62% of banking and financial services 
 

""The credit card business is about identifying behavior-based signals as early as possible so you can be in front of the prospect with an appealing offer,"" says a senior VP of a leading credit card issuer.


#1 Marketers Continue to Prefer Digital Communications Channels


 	As in the awareness-building stage, digital communications channels continue to dominate when companies seek to convert prospects to customers. 
 

 	For those who produce communications for this stage, all use digital media advertising and company websites.
 

 	Companies are getting more scientific about assessing the impact of the marketing mix. 
 

""Being able to see the touchpoints that prospects interact with has gone a long way toward demystifying the sales process. Now we better understand the role of marketing,""  says a regional head of marketing of a global wealth management company.
 



#2 Person-To-Person Techniques Are Becoming Less Important in Consumer Industries


 	Comparing the marketing channels of conversion used in consumer industries (B2C and B2B2C) and B2B sectors shows big differences.
 

 	Leaders appear to be abandoning techniques that rely on real-time human interaction like deploying field sales teams. For example, about 33% of followers deploy a field sales force, only 21% of leaders do so. 
 

Some 68% of B2B marketers use field sales forces to convert prospects to customers-almost five times the percentage of consumer marketers (14%).


Fewer than 2 out of 5 leaders (37%) use event marketing, while more than 3 out of 5 followers (62%) do so.



#3 Innovative Use of Digital Channels Continues to Distinguish Marketing Leaders


 	In the Conversion stage, 37% of leaders versus 21% of followers are more likely to buy ads on other companies' e-commerce sites, such as Amazon.com and Walmart.com. Sectors leading this trend are automotive, insurance and CPG.
 

79% of leaders are more likely to use their mobile apps as a conversion channel compared to 67% of followers. Automotive, insurance, and media, entertainment & information rely more on mobile apps than other sectors.



#4 Leaders Value Print Media Advertising Over Email Marketing


 	Leaders surpass followers across the board in using digital channels such as social media and video sites, with one exception: email, where followers are marginally more active (95% vs. 92%). 
 

 	In contrast to email, leaders maintain a higher regard for print advertising.
 

97% of leaders are more likely than followers (88%) to use print ads to persuade prospects to become customers.


#5 Demographic Data Is Most Frequently Used for Personalized Messages But Other Types Are Gaining Traction


 	Marketers that created messages in the Conversion stage most frequently depended on prospects' demographic data for personalizing those messages. 
 

 	47% said that the second most frequently used data for personalization was web traffic.
 

 	Geo-location data was used by 44% of all companies, with 41% using social media behavior data. 
 


 	But there were distinct differences between B2B and B2C companies in the data they use for personalized marketing messages in Stage 2.
 

 	■ Demographic data: 83% of B2C marketers use it vs. 59% of B2B marketers
 

 	■ Web traffic data: 51% of B2C marketers use it data vs. only 28% of B2B marketers
 

 	■ Geo-location data: 54% of B2C companies use it vs. only 1% of B2B marketers
 


Best Practices In Action: How Leaders Keep the Customer Satisfied


Leading US Airline Leverages Data to Land High-Value Passengers


Summary: This airline uses rich sources of data to identify the most desirable customers and determine the best ways and times to reach them. 


Challenge: Gaining Brand Recognition
	In 2018 this nationally known airline spent about $500 million on marketing to ensure that new customers choose and continue to choose it as their carrier of choice. To achieve this goal, the airline focused on attracting high-value passengers, a small group of frequent premium travelers, by creating awareness about the airline's business products and attributes and building loyalty, so that the airline becomes their carrier of choice whenever they fly. 


	Harnessing data is vital to landing these passengers, which is plentiful from the travel booking process and from co-branded products and partners. This data includes personal information, flying preferences, booking channels, co-branded products (such as credit cards), travel partners (like Airbnb, Marriott, for example) and more. 


Solution: Targeting High-Value Flyers
	This airline uses data not only to identify prospects, but to understand them and to know when they're ripe for marketing messages. In fact, this data allows them to create a dynamic ""lifecycle map"" that lets them know when a customer is convertible and when they are not. 


	It's challenging to overcome a competitor's frequent flyer program, so this airline focuses on a marketing strategy designed to establish and build relationships with new customers, like college students, who might seem to be a low-yield traveler at best. But the airline targets students enrolled in universities and studying topics that put them on a track to be high-value passengers in the future. 


Outcome: Using Digital Data to Drive Incremental Business
	To reach these largely young prospects, social media is essential. This particular airline rises above the digital noise by acting like a friend-a hip and generous one. For example, it has on occasion gifted its credit-card customers with free treats at various well-known chains to inspire its young social-media-obsessed customers to spread the word, even offering incentives for those who shared the experience the chance to win 50,000 miles.


	When high-value passengers slip through the cracks, the previously mentioned customer lifecycle map identifies opportunities to win them back. For example, when there are disruptions due to weather or mechanical issues, booking agents for other air carriers will ""re-accommodate"" valuable customers on this airline. This rebooking process gives access to the customer information for thank-you emails and texts as well as for other incentives and offers to reel those customers back in. 


When high-value passengers slip through the cracks, this airline's dynamic customer lifecycle map leverages customer data and identifies opportunities to win them back based on this information.


About This Research


 	This short report is based on just a portion of a 45-question online survey to capture what CMOs do in the Conversion stage (Stage 2) in creating communications for prospects and customers. In forthcoming reports, we will publish our findings on how the same marketing organizations are using digital technologies to personalize communications in the other two stages; Stage 3 is customer support; and Stage 4 is customer retention). 
 

 	Our first release gave an overview of the initial research findings and the final master report will be released later in 2019 with a comprehensive analysis into the CMO Study results. Read what CMOs do in our previously published Awareness (Stage 1) report ""Attracting the Digitally Distracted Prospect"".
 

The CMOs we surveyed work in: 


■ 11 industries 
■ Companies with at least $500 million in annual revenue, with most in much larger companies 
■ Firms with average revenue $10.6 billion and the average annual marketing budget was $392 million 
■ About two-thirds (65%) were from consumer companies (both B2C and B2B2C firms), while 27% were from B2B companies
■ The remaining 8% worked in companies with a fairly balanced mix of B2C and B2B end customers 
■ 60% work in North America, and 40% work in Europe
 

Research Goals & Methodology 	 	
 	Our research goals were to determine: 
 

■ How technology-enabled personalized marketing content today is used throughout the brand experience for prospects and customers (in their marketing and sales campaigns, and customer support and retention initiatives)
■ The impact of such personalization and the key factors in making it effective
■ How CMOs and their organizations develop communications across all stages of the customer lifecycle
 

 	The research looks in depth at what marketers are doing in each of the four stages: what channels are being used by companies in different industries, different target end customers (consumers vs. organizations), and different countries; what data companies are using to personalize communications; how they are personalizing communications based on the data they possess on prospects and customers; and how the most successful marketers differ from the rest in channel usage, data for personalization, and types of personalization.
 

 	The study findings, based on a mix of B2C, B2B, and B2B2C, are segmented into key stages of the customer journey and will be released in 4 short reports, all of which will be found here: Innovating Brand Experiences Through Digital Transformation.
 

Stage 1 (Creating Awareness): Attracting the Digitally Distracted Prospect
 

Stage 2 (Prospect Conversion): Personalizing Content to Turn Prospects into Customers
 

Stage 3 (Customer Support): Interacting Digitally to Become Invaluable Customer Advisers
 

Stage 4 (Customer Retention): Using Analytics to Predict What Customers Need Next
 

Master Report: How Leading CMOs Captivate and Convert Customers for Life 
This comprehensive report to be released in late 2019 consolidates the findings and provides in-depth analysis and surprising new insights about how leading marketers differ from the rest in the innovative use of digital technologies, data, and analytics to personalize the brand experience-within, across and outside all four stages of the customer journey.
