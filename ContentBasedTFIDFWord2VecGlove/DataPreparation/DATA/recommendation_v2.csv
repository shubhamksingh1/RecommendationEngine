1,peter drucker the legendary management scholar and consultant noted in a harvard business review article that the assumptions businesses make about customer behaviors competitors and markets constitute their theory of business the theory that a company develops dictates what it should do and how it should do it and can be a powerful tool to guide the enterprise however when those assumptions no longer reflect reality the decisions a company makes that once led to profitability can lead it astray the failure to change the theory and the assumptions that undergird it to align with the new reality drucker wrote is at the root of all business crises today because customer behaviors markets and competitors have all changed and continue to change rapidly business theories do not reflect reality for very long this is why so many companies especially those most affected by the digitization of everything are in crisis it is why they need to revise their theories of business to become smarter faster and lighter the revolution in customer behaviorhow much have business theories changed over this decade look at one aspect of customer behavior the shopping patterns of consumers just a few years ago when a shopper entered a store his or her choice was limited to what was on the shelves today armed with smart mobile devices enabled by free pervasive wifi a customer in store a can compare the price and quality of what is on the shelves with an entire universe of competing productsobtain instant reviews of products from social media channelstext friends about their experiences with the products or ask trusted strangers in online consumer forumspurchase the product from store b while standing in store a s aislethis complex path to purchase promises to grow more varied not less according to a study of shoppers interacted digitally prior to shopping while only used a digital device during the shopping process said they planned to do so in the near future just one year later u s car buyers spent of their time purchasing a vehicle doing online research by the time they went to a dealer decided to buy the car they intended to purchase if companies want to influence the customer s purchase they need to do it much earlier in the so called customer journey 3a theory of business based on a static linear customer journey or one that prescribes a rigid customer experience no longer reflects reality the digitally shifting competitive landscapetraditionally a company s growth strategy was to become the market leader in its core market segments and then protect that position against competitors but that does not account for the fact that competitors now emerge from different segments in for example nokia was the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world it had a robust well funded r d function and seemingly unassailable scale in it still had over a third of the market 4after apple launched the iphone in and google s android operating system came online the next year nokia s theory of the business became instantly obsolete nokia was not defeated by another cell phone maker it lost market share to a computer company and an online firm apple and google developed technologies with an ecosystem that used the network effect which made them valuable in the eyes of the consumers 5a theory of business that fails to account for competitors emerging from entirely different sectors of the economy no longer reflects the reality of global competition due to powerful and fast evolving technologies easy access to capital and lower barriers to entry companies need to look beyond their segments and geographies to keep a weather eye out for fast emerging competitors the metamorphosis of marketsnokia s size did not protect it indeed scale long an axiomatic part of strategies designed to dominate markets has become less important and sometimes burdensome in part this is due to the increasing power of emerging markets by it is estimated that developing economies could account for nearly of global demand for manufactured goods 6increasingly this shift in demand is forcing companies to personalize their offerings for markets by focusing on regional production as have been the strategies of ikea p g emerson and others this new reality can be seen clearly in the pharmaceutical sector large regulatory agencies like the u s food and drug administration and the european medical agency have been promulgating faster approvals of new personalized medicines for unmet medical needs in small patient populations to take advantage of these new pathways drug developers must be able to respond rapidly to guidance from regulators smaller more agile companies unburdened by outdated workflows and less top heavy can make faster decisions and take advantage of regulator input more quickly than larger companies these small companies with one or two drugs in their pipelines can achieve enormous market valuations in short times they move faster because they are much lighter organizations than big pharma how to get smarter faster and lighterhow can companies change their theories of business to become smarter faster and lighter at the speed of these digitally driven transformations we explain how to do it in the three sections of this edition of perspectives getting smarterone of the themes of this section is that companies must harness artificial intelligence ai tcs harrick vin explains two key challenges that ai poses to companies in our interview with dartmouth professor vijay govindarajan he discusses how to accelerate culture changes of the type that digital technology is forcing companies to make tcs satya ramaswamy s harvard business review article reprinted here in perspectives explains one big change that nearly every company will have to make over the rest of the decade to get smarter listening and acting quickly upon the digital data that is streaming in from the wireless sensors they have installed in their products whether your company makes cars coffee machines or barbecues it must give special treatment to such internet of things data that shows how your products are performing for customers we also profile the associated press the year old news service that has been using ai to produce quarterly earnings stories without dedicating staff to write them by the end of the software was generating quarterly earnings stories covering all listed u s companies and some in canada that has freed up ap s human workforce to do the deeper enterprise reporting its member newspapers need however getting smarter through ai forces companies to get far better at analyzing the digital data that is coursing through their data centers in her article tcs lipika dey explains the new tools for doing such crucial analytics our interview with university of texas at austin professor prabhudev konana explores the metrics and skills necessary for analytics to have impact in an organization finally in this section the head of tcs banking financial services practice k krithivasan explains how banks and financial services firm are using analytics to make better decisions getting fasteras tonya mckinney and dave anderson explain in their article on dynamic customer journeys companies must design their customer journeys to respond to changes faster they must also change their journeys in an agile iterative fashion by monitoring every consumer channel and every touch point continuously tcs sunder singh and akhilesh tiwari discuss in their article how global companies are getting faster at implementing enterprise systems ajoy mukerjee tcs global head and vice president of human resources explores how big companies can identify the key talent they will need long before others do companies need to turn uncertainty about who the new competitors may be into their advantage as ceo consultant ram charan explains in our interview with him our case study on microsoft s embrace of machine learning shows how companies can gain share for instance the search engine market by adopting new approaches to enhance digital products at the end of this section the heads of tcs retail pratik pal and life sciences practices debashis ghosh explain how companies are getting quicker at understanding their performance for customers and integrating acquisitions getting lighterto get lighter companies need to embrace technologies that reduce their it burden and costs such as cloud computing automation and software as a service saas at the same time they should seek expertise of third parties without having to inflate their workforces this is what nidhi srivastava global head of it consulting at tcs examines in her article getting lighter places even greater demands on companies that make multiple acquisitions they need to quickly integrate the operations of their newly purchased companies for example in six months rather than years as tcs vice president of business consulting dave jordan lays out in his article merging it intensive operations is one of the best ways for two companies to shed excess weight business processes applications hardware and other infrastructure that are no longer necessary when one company is taken over by another companies that can profit from changing environments and are built to incorporate continuous transformations will be the ones all of us will be doing business with tomorrow and for the foreseeable future in our interview with professor jeanne ross of the mit sloan school she explains how digital companies are able to move at the speed of light and the lessons for established companies that now must become digital big data tool provider cloudera is using its own technology to identify the changes its customers must make on the systems it runs for them as its chief strategy officer mike olson explains in the case study on the company and the head of tcs manufacturing practice milind lakkad explains

2,the software development community has been using the term agile for more than years but over the last decade agile approaches have jumped the tracks to the rest of the business world the reason is clear the success of large companies now depends on using digital technologies to reinvent their business models automate and monitor the performance of their products and services using embedded wireless sensors use technologies to bring intelligence and personalized interactions with customers and make all this possible by tapping into the huge on demand computing power of cloud providers each article in this issue of perspectives dissects today s urgent need for companies to have industrial strength capabilities in agile to manage their businesses we group the articles in three sections the essence of agilein embracing agility means agility by the business for the business nidhi srivastava of tcs discusses why big companies must embrace agile practices when they build new businesses design new business processes and develop the systems that support them as she explains a big reason is that digital natives companies born on the internet like google facebook uber airbnb and amazon have inherent advantages over older companies established companies need to get agile quickly to compete however srivastava also shows why they shouldn t attempt to make every part of their organization agile all at the same time instead they need to phase in agile approaches carefully the next article in this section explains how in the early days of agile software development the idea was to bring business people and software developers into the same room today that s a quaint notion agile teams in many enterprises stretch across time zones it s now unrealistic to expect all agile team members to sit side by side in their article how to make location independent agile work k subramanian and mohammed musthafa s explain how to make dispersed agile team members work as one it may seem like a 21st century phenomenon but the mandate for big companies to become more agile actually goes back decades as mit sloan school prof michael cusumano reminds us in our recent interview with him from making autos to making software the evolution of lean and agile in the 1980s japanese automobile manufacturers were producing cars faster on the assembly line than their u s and european peers with less labor and fewer defects all the while reducing the time it took to develop new models cusumano and his mit colleagues referred to these manufacturing methods as lean in many ways it was a precursor to agile software powerhouse microsoft which cusumano studied in the 1990s applied what are now called agile practices to designing and developing software before the authors of the agile manifesto put their label on the practice and posted their document in in our interview cusumano lays out what s new and old about agile applying agileinnovation is a fundamental reason why companies adopt agile management practices that is the ability to source promising ideas and turn them into new products services processes and even new businesses at lightning speed in their article enterprise agility pushing innovation to the edge of the organization tcs consultants courtney wood and apala mukherjee show why some of the best agile adopters have empowered their people on the front lines to identify new business opportunities if you think that agile is something everyone below you in your organization needs to learn but not you then think again in their article effective leadership of agile organizations building a culture of servant leadership nidhi srivastava and carl shea discuss why leaders of organizations that wish to become agile must absorb the mindsets and master the skills required to make those below them successful in the last article in this section we are honored to have a pioneer of silicon valley style lean and agile approaches he is steve blank a silicon valley entrepreneur who has been a cog in the wheel of the lean startup movement blank more recently has been teaching lean startup approaches to big longstanding organizations both in business and government he tells us about that in our interview with him the tall task of getting big companies and government to innovate like lean startups agile at worktaking the lead from the digital natives they increasingly compete against two industries have been at the forefront of adopting agile practices retail and financial services in their article how retail ceos can drive agile to grow their business rajashree r and pratik pal of tcs explain how several large retailers have used agile approaches to bring innovative business models business processes and customer offerings to market faster they show why taking half measures with agile don t go far enough in keeping retailers competitive because money essentially is a product that can be fully digital banks and financial services firms have been under attack for years from digitally savvy startups that have made mortgage and auto loans faster payments and payment processing easier and stock trades cheaper in their article fending off the fintechs how agile financial services firms are transforming their businesses tcs consultants ramanamurthy magapu and sathish sankaranarayanan explain how a number of established financial institutions have used agile approaches to strike back successfully they also explain how to get past the barriers that hold financial services firms from embracing agile practices finally in our last article why your agile team is better off dispersed the case for location independent agile i explain why large companies around the world now need to significantly scale up their agile approaches to process improvement product and service development and business model innovation i show why scaling up agile requires making it truly location independent,agile s day has truly arrived
3,many exciting new digital technologies have evolved rapidly this decade–potent mobile devices that perform a myriad of tasks big data and analytics tools that crunch petabytes of data and internet of things sensors that report continuously on everything from our cars to our coffee pots so it may surprise you that a far older technology–artificial intelligence ai –is poised to become the primary driver of business transformation by how can that be given that ai has occupied the pages of science fiction for at least years and technology labs for more than while it sounds old hat compared to emerging technologies ai is beginning to revolutionize the way companies do business that is why we see articles every week about what cognitive systems are achieving or can achieve driving cars without anyone in them over long stretches beating the world s best player at a complex game the asian game go is the latest outperforming surgeons at stitching up a pig and spitting out financial stories faster than even a big newsroom could it is also why new multibillion dollar businesses for services are flourishing–uber for taxis airbnb for booking rooms and the personal digital assistants of google microsoft amazon and others for sure they are capitalizing on a bunch of digital technologies but it is the modern strain of artificial intelligence or cognitive technologies if you prefer the more modern nomenclature which now makes them possible to put it succinctly the cognitive wave is here the question is whether your company is ready to ride it that is what this article will try to answer it will give you an overview of the technology and explain the two biggest challenges to using cognitive tools to transform your business in the years ahead the basics what is cognitive technology to understand why cognitive technologies will be transformative you first have to understand what they are and what they can do think of cognitive technologies as performing four core tasks senseuntil the last few years computers have been very poor at doing what humans do with ease scanning the environment around them and understanding the context the reason is that most computers had neither the capabilities nor the processing power to analyze anything but structured data by structured i mean the transaction data of a spreadsheet or database with numbers in it unstructured data is the source food for cognitive systems the text of a call center s transcript of a customer conversation the thousands of online articles published every day the static images of pictures and moving images of video and so on the world is full of digitized data today and it is doubling every two years according to idc 1between and it is predicted to increase ten fold but or more of it is unstructured which is one reason that only an estimated of digital data in could be analyzed but this is changing cognitive technologies can increasingly assimilate and mine unstructured data in a wide range of formats extract relevant information from them e g existence of a person or an animal in a picture or extracting sentiments from a blob of text handle multiple overlapping data sources and versions and perform data integrity and completeness checks among other tasks this kind of capability is opening up a complex new world of possibilities thinka cognitive system is not useful if it only recognizes data it must also decide what that data means and at the speed of light cognitive technologies use machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze the context gleaned during the sense phase to understand and characterize normal behavior this is used to predict future system behavior under expected and anomalous conditions as well as produce actionable insights and recommendations actafter the system has arrived at some insights it needs to drive an automatic reaction that corrects things if a car manufacturer has trained an onboard system to sense electronic control data from its automobiles and discern when they are heading for mechanical problems the system must also figure out proactive actions to correct those problems and improve customer experience a driverless car is ai on four wheels an automobile that is continually sensing thinking and acting in order to avoid all the hazards of busy roads cognitive systems think and act like experts unlike a robot they do not need to be programmed with explicit instructions to perform actions in all possible contexts the system may encounter instead cognitive systems mimic the human brain they combine self learned context with reusable patterns to construct procedures to perform complex activities utilizing reusable simple skills learnthe best cognitive systems do not stop at acting on some data that they have analyzed through technologies such as machine learning they are able to continuously refine their knowledge and algorithmic models based on the real world outcomes from them like people cognitive systems need to be designed to learn from experience the systems experience most cognitive systems support two methods for continuous learning explicit training and observational self learning why is it important now the perfect storma new class of computer systems can now sense think act and learn why is that happening now and where is it all going it is happening now because what we are witnessing today is the perfect digital storm products processes and information systems today are getting hyper instrumented and hyper connected wireless sensors in devices ranging from mobile phones and cars to computer printers are reporting on their performance extensive networks are connecting everything big data and analytics technologies can crunch the data that is being emitted so all the technical elements of the perfect storm the digital technologies that can guide what people need to do are in place entrepreneurs like elon musk the connected self driving electric car travis kalanick uber and brian chesky and joe gebbia airbnb are the ones turning those perfect storm elements into viable new businesses that are giving entrenched industries a run for their money uber does not own taxis or taxi drivers they are contractors yet its latest round of fund raising valued it at more than billion in its revenues in its home san francisco market alone were more than three times what taxis were generating in the city clearly consumers are using uber much more than taxis for its convenience and other reasons clearly uber has seized the perfect storm of digital technologies and it is reshaping a century old industry is your industry next and if so is your company prepared preparing for the stormto be able to lead this cognitive wave companies will have to overcome several challenges they are many and disparate but you could group them into two broad categories technical challenges and people and safety challenges let us start with the technical ones oddly enough technical does not mean technology it is really about knowledge and how to codify it so you can train an ai system to do the task you want it to do whether it is to drive a car perform a surgery monitor and protect a household when the family is away or even at home and much more no matter how much sophisticated technology is in a cognitive system and how well it can sense think act and learn about some issue it will not be useful unless it can also collect and sense the right digital data think and act on that data and then perfect its learning for the future take the self driving automobile its developers whether they are at tesla or toyota must understand the physics of a car the physics of braking the physics of other objects such as other cars trucks deer and people that share the road with it the physics of weather and every part of the internal and external physical environment that enables the car to operate without colliding into something to cite one narrow slice of this how much braking should be applied in bad conditions such as rain or snow does it depend on the weight of the car yes the height of the car yes the speed of the car yes the road conditions yes and that in turn means the developers of the self driving car need to capture that knowledge coherently that is not the topic that most people talk about when discussing ai and cognitive technologies they are largely discussing the technology pieces the natural language software the image recognition technologies and so on that is all necessary but not sufficient you need to capture the domain knowledge necessary to train a car to drive as expertly and hopefully better than the most skillful drivers that is a huge barrier and it takes a huge amount of effort to overcome it the second challenge involves the people and safety issues the people issues are probably the most perplexing what new jobs might arise in that firm given that the doers of work can be liberated from those manual jobs and become creators and curators of knowledge tcs conducted a major study this year of what more than mostly big companies are doing with ai one big finding was that the companies getting the greatest value from the technology in terms of revenue and cost improvements can envision the technology both automating more jobs and creating additional new jobs as compared to the companies realizing less value from ai what happens to a company that can automate of its workforce through ai systems cognitive systems are about to unleash huge changes in big companies which i boil down to automating the work of the doers and liberating them to take on the new jobs of creation and curation of knowledge but that of course poses big questions for companies how do they determine which jobs can be automated how do they determine what the new jobs will be and then how do they retrain and redeploy people for those new jobs it figures to be a massive job and skill shift that will keep many chief hr officers awake at night history however does indicate that this problem is solvable a deloitte study found that during the past years new technologies have created more jobs than they have destroyed 4as for the safety issues how do we make products and processes powered by cognitive systems safe for people and for companies consider the self driving car example again when you design and develop the autonomous vehicle to avoid an accident if the choice is between the driver suffering in a crash or another car or pedestrian suffering which one does the system choose it is a huge ethical and probably legal dilemma the other safety issue is one we have heard about for decades computer security how do we build cognitive systems that cannot be hacked or at least easily hacked in our study this turned out to be the biggest challenge for the 800+ companies we surveyed and it is not likely to go away jumping on the waveexperienced surfers know how to time the waves just right the same will hold true with companies and cognitive systems but it is becoming more evident by the day that most large companies across most industries need to climb on top of that board now because the perfect conditions are here it is time to begin exploring and investing seriously and strategically in harnessing the power of cognitive systems to reimagine your business idc the digital universe

4,we have all seen some eye bulging numbers in recent years about the internet of things iot since general electric has publicly stated it would spend more than billion on developing sensors wireless devices and related software to install on its aircraft engines power turbines locomotive trains and other machinery companies such as ford toyota and caterpillar have invested heavily as well and our own survey of large companies average revenue of billion in north america europe asia paciﬁc and latin america found average per company spending on iot initiatives million in was projected to grow to million by yet it would be a mistake to think that iot is a game only for high rollers and crack technologists our research and client engagement experience has shown us that generating strong returns from the digital sensors wireless communications devices digital cameras installed in buildings and other smart connected devices does not come down to writing big checks or being technologically savvy the companies with the greatest value from iot to date are the best at dealing with how products are performing for customers once you accept that it becomes a lot easier to understand what you need to do to get value from iot of course every company eventually gets the truth about how its products and services are performing for customers the call center logs customer complaints spot surveys become snapshots of limited customer input more recently social media monitoring tools have given companies the means of seeing who is sounding oﬀ on their oﬀerings around the clock and around the world but for many companies such truth often comes too late after customers have decided to ﬁnd another supplier consider a recent example a friend s coﬀeemaker that he purchased two years ago just went on the blink it was an expensive machine but it is past the warranty period his wife called the manufacturer who walked her through a troubleshooting routine but to no avail the rep then said the company would mail the customer a diagnostic tool in days so the customer could troubleshoot it further like the two thirds of american adults who consume at least one cup of coﬀee a day according to gallup he and his wife are miﬀed they need a coﬀee maker right away and will not wait at least a week to get a possible ﬁx for the machine they have they told me they will now buy a competing brand the manufacturer could have avoided losing its customer had it installed a wireless digital sensor that reported on how well the machine was performing if it had the ﬁrm might have been able to alert the customer that the machine was headed for downtime before it happened and sent the diagnostic tool before it broke down now the company will lose out on the big revenue stream from this customer that follows the machine the money from its coﬀee pods this kind of data on how a company s product is performing in the ﬁeld for customers is indeed the ultimate truth because it can alert companies to product problems and customers who are about to defect this truth could be very diﬀerent from what the company thought it was or was marketing it as it is the ultimate truth because most companies get this information far too late when a loyal customer has left them behind without a dear john note in our survey we found that as of last year only of big companies had put iot technologies into their products in other words three out of four did not have the means to get the ultimate truth on product performance what is more that percentage generally goes down the lower the price of a product for example only of companies selling products with less than price tags had embedded wireless sensors in their oﬀerings in contrast of companies whose products average sales price was between million and million did have digital sensors that communicated product performance back to them but even if your ﬁrm has installed iot technologies in its products that does not mean it is about to get the ultimate truth about those products or that it will do something with that information that requires your ﬁrm to do much more we see four key elements of using the iot to get the ultimate truth on product performance getting customers to agree to have their products monitored which in turn means giving them something of value in return to get value from the iot you have to give value ﬁrst or as intel corp s vice president and gm of its billion iot business jonathan ballon says the beneﬁt has to be to customers there has to be a value exchange he told us this is especially the case when a company s wireless sensors are transmitting sensitive customer data such as medical conditions hp inc the part of the old hewlett packard that makes printers printing ink pcs and other digital devices has found the same thing in its hp instant ink initiative hp outﬁtted its printers in with wireless sensors that monitor ink levels and automatically trigger reorders before customers run out so hp dangled cost savings of up to and solved a problem i e running out of ink and it enticed many customers the cio of hp inc naresh shanker told us there has to be customer value cost savings very high quality ink a great customer experience all of that product performance data must be processed and acted upon quickly had my friend s coﬀee maker been equipped with a digital sensor the manufacturer may have had the chance to keep him a loyal customer but that would have required it to be able to quickly process huge volumes of digital data think about companies with millions of customers and millions of products in the ﬁeld and that would have then required the company to trigger an automated response e g a customer call center to reach out to the customer an email to be sent out saying for example that they will try to diagnose and ﬁx the problem remotely and then if the ﬁx is deduced an enterprise resource planning system that is triggered to order a part to arrive at the customer if the customer can ﬁx it himself and issue a bill for that part in other words a company s iot systems must be connected to its erp systems for billing distribution repair and other activities to make the product right so now the product is not just the physical object that was sold to the customer but also the entire set of systems and experiences that stand behind it a culture that accepts the truth however bad of all the technologies that companies have implemented in the last years the iot may face the greatest organizational resistance what product line leaders production heads or r d executives will want the ceo to know on a daily basis that the products that they developed and delivered are having trouble in the ﬁeld with customers said intel s ballon without question the biggest barrier to the internet of things by a large margin is cultural it s organizational inertia that gets in the way people are afraid what new technologies might reveal about the business from our survey we found one of the many ways companies that had gained the biggest beneﬁts to date from the iot diﬀered from the rest is the support for iot at the top of the company the companies i ﬁnd that are brave are driving this change from the top said ballon the more timid and change averse companies tend to dig in with their feet get lost in the weeds and take too long to make technology decisions reimagining the business must become the mantra digital technologies like the internet of things allow companies to do things operationally that were impossible or infeasible before technology for monitoring product performance has been used for decades but largely on very expensive and critical products such as public elevators you do not want people to be trapped in an elevator very long and companies like otis elevator have outﬁtted their products for years with technologies that report on such outages the internet of things gives companies the opportunity to monitor product performance of the cheapest of products for example procter gamble has had an electronic toothbrush with wireless sensors for two years in our research we found companies such as grocery giant kroger reducing checkout lines through technology that monitors its stores auto insurers have been oﬀering usage based policies based on technologies that track the way customers actually drive simply by leveraging their customers existing smartphones the opportunities to reimagine how to do business are abundant but they only happen to companies that are open to reimagining the way they have done business for years when companies are prepared to deal with these four they will be far more likely to see and act eﬀectively on the possibilities of the internet of things by dealing with the ultimate truth well how their products are performing every day for customers they will be far more likely to keep their customers for the long haul this article was

5,you probably need little evidence to believe that the experience your company provides to its customers in learning about buying and using your offerings is hugely important today but for the few doubting thomases left in the business world i have data google data that is as you might know google tracks the world s digital information according to its indexing of books since the 1980s seen in figure using the google ngram viewer1 the term customer experience trawls along the bottom of the chart until a time in which and not so coincidentally customer relationship management systems began sprouting up in large corporations one of the pioneers and early powerhouses of crm software siebel systems was born just four years before that then the curve shoots up all the way through the last year for which google s ngram viewer provides results figure the rise in interest in customer experience as shown in books indexed by google 2so what about since we turn to another google product google trends it indexes how many times the term was used in google searches the answer the popularity of the term has more than doubled since as shown in figure below figure the rise in interest in customer experience as shown in trends indexed by google 3the notion of the customer experience is mesmerizing many c suites and it s not a fad that will fade away we believe it s not only here to stay but that it will become paramount in fact many large companies in recent years have come to amazon founder jeff bezos epiphany becoming obsessed with customers the time to transform the experience your company provides customers is now not in two years not by but now in this issue of tcs perspectives we show you how the following articles lay out the thinking of top tcs customer experience experts consultants who work on the front lines with clients whether they make industrial goods consumer products or automobiles or whether they provide services such as walking through retail stores and bank branches or seats on an airplane or rooms in a hotel allow me to tell you a little bit about each article and what i believe makes it noteworthy designing customer experiences cx forget everything you know about bricks and clicks it s wrong or soon will be authors david nelson and jim walb make a compelling case about why every company must look outside their industry to vault ahead in the customer experience the key is to look at firms that provide superior outcomes for customers because ultimately that s all that matters the four core competencies of cx interview with bruce temkin the temkin group has become renowned for its stellar research on cx leaders in many industries and its practical advice bruce lays out four core competencies that he believes are necessary for companies to provide a superior customer experience purposeful leadership compelling brand values customer connectedness and employee engagement when cx should begin with tweaks not disruption not every company must come to market with a disruptive customer experience some only need small adjustments to generate greater customer loyalty revenue and profit paul ignasinski explores two steps by which companies can identify those opportunities and put their resources against them the seven deadly myths of today s b2b sell in business to business customer interactions the experience that sales people provide make or break relationships every day lisa hager sheds light on seven myths that many b2b sales executives and their teams operate under beliefs about selling that were once sacrosanct but no longer are she also explains what to do about them personalization boundaries tuning in to customers without turning them off every company today can and must tailor its interactions especially the digital ones with customers in fact research says customers expect it until the personal touch turns them off dave anderson and keith wheeler explain how to keep within seven guardrails and prevent personalization from becoming creepy designing for the small silver screen the iphone was introduced years ago and mobile apps now consume hours each day in the average consumer s life it s critical for companies to design their apps right which isn t easy because the competition is intense and app technology grows ever more powerful two of our app experts oghie ojior and skip vanderburg give you three ways to raise your app game not every company must come to market with a disruptive customer experience some only need small adjustments to generate greater customer loyalty revenue and profit the cx after the salehow iot technologies are revamping the post sale experience the internet of things seems to be as popular a topic as customer experience there s good reason for that companies that embed digital sensors in their products and on the premises in which they do business can track customers and how they are using those products authors gill hide alex prigojine and robert perry explain five fundamental ways that companies can use iot technologies to dramatically improve what customers do with your offerings after they buy or rent them reimagining the contact center with digital technologies the call center is a thing of the past companies now need contact centers whose employees and increasingly ai driven systems respond to customers who phone in email type in social media comments and text message their questions and complaints natarajan baskaran and rohit kale explain how to evolve the call center in three stages the magic that can happen when manufacturers digitally attach themselves to their products the internet of things is not only turning consumer sectors inside out it s now redefining the way industrial and other manufacturers relate to their customers as sreenivasa chakravarti and subhash sakorikar explain companies that take six bold steps can do wonders in improving the experience that customers have in using their products using iot technologies to completely rethink the customer experience interview with ric merrifield merrifield has been at the intersection of digital technology and business

6,today s companies do not struggle to collect a lot of data they struggle to wring value from that data thanks to big data tools becoming mainstream during the last few years many companies have gathered huge data sets few have grabbed the real prize using that data to make smarter business decisions in new product development customer service marketing sales and other key business functions what is holding them back companies across all industry vertical segments from telecom to manufacturing see the potential of analytics and seek to gain competitive advantage from it and they are spending heavily to do so revenues for sellers of big data and business analytics will rise from billion in to billion in globally according to research firm international data corporation idc 1despite all that spending several challenges prevent many companies from realizing strong roi on analytics projects for starters companies struggle to find the right metrics for analytics projects next given the amount of data that can be collected think petabytes in a day companies often wrestle with carving out subsets for targeted analysis notably companies may ignore or fail to fully tap into rich new data sources such as social data and mobile app data in another significant obstacle companies face an increasing amount of unstructured data to analyze such as text images and voice calls this is not ignorable data some useful business insights say on customer satisfaction issues will only come up in unstructured data companies can analyze this unstructured data to improve customer satisfaction and brand image association for example but analyzing unstructured data adds a layer of complexity to analytics projects for example how do you coordinate this information with structured business data from traditional enterprise software additionally unstructured data comes in from multiple channels phone calls email social media posts surveys and each channel has pros and cons for instance if you are analyzing social media posts you may not know what percentage of your customers are using social media internal contact center data offers better statistical estimates additionally fake customer reviews are a well known phenomenon in social media and elsewhere online companies must address such reviews but these reviews do not offer value for analytics projects a judicious approach is to listen to social media posts for signals pointing to particular issues then collect more data around each issue in a systematic fashion through targeted questions or surveys for valuable analysis unstructured data mining can also raise privacy concerns especially health and insurance data finally too much analytical data remains in too many business silos how do you identify and share the data most wanted by front line managers to enable better decision making this is where speed comes in you cannot be smart if you cannot get insight to the front line fast one key is mapping analytics work to the right business owners and processes pursuing holistic analytics work across departments and functions rather than doing siloed analytics work is key to producing strong roi for the business shortcomings of current analytics approaches and toolstoday s analytics tools and techniques can fall short in several respects for companies seeking to turn data into valuable business insights to wield against rivals often judging the roi of analytics projects proves tough because some companies track too many metrics or the wrong metrics for example social media analysis often gets stuck with key performance indicators kpis like positive and negative sentiment indices or number of likes or shares but the number of likes or shares on its own does not indicate how many people have actually read or heard the content traditional industry data streams for example from finance and sales software do not reveal enough they are tapped out what is more every one of your competitors use the same data in the same way which does not offer much hope for competitive differentiation this leads smart companies to think creatively about additional data sources for example online real estate company trulia analyzes more than a terabyte of data daily in its work to give personalized suggestions to potential home buyers its multiple data streams include new home listings public records and user behavior data when a new listing matches a customer s preferences the customer gets an alert traditional bi systems share data through reports however well built analytics dashboards enable business side managers to ask more and smarter questions leading to smarter decisions for example walmart analyzes social streams3 facebook twitter pinterest to feed data into social media analytics dashboards for its product buyers who can capitalize on customer interest in products such as juice machines or a particular shade of nail polish deploying such dashboards is not easy analytics teams may think that if they just get the right bi tool to the business they have cracked the problem but business users seek prescriptive advice not just attractive visualizations for the tool to gain widespread use and effectiveness while more companies now collect unstructured data many still keep too much of it in departmental or other organizational silos while more companies now collect unstructured data many still keep too much of it in departmental or other organizational silos for instance social media data may be collected and analyzed in one business silo and so will support center and call center data today s bi tools do not help much with visualization of unstructured data or linking structured data to unstructured data what is more models of how to deal with unstructured data are not mature yet so companies fail to find best practice models as a result of all these factors companies focus too much on handling the volume of data and not enough on cutting across business silos to find the right information at the right time the magic moment when business value appears a smarter analytics approachsuccessful analytics projects seek to flip that focus and cut across the boundaries that keep valuable information trapped let us delve into some techniques companies are using to overcome the challenges and derive more value from analytics work starting with finding the right metrics this starts with rethinking kpis for analytics projects if you want different departments to work together you must look for a holistic or cross department measure for example on customer service analysis projects do not use call resolution but single contact resolution across all channels such as email phone and social media this ensures that social customer service teams drive towards the one and done ideology so customers are not just hopping to another channel for answers rather than creating and tracking a separate set of kpis for unstructured data seek to link the analytical insights to business processes and thus standard business kpis this helps prove business value and roi to do this companies can use software tools to model the relevant business knowledge organized by business divisions products or attributes of products capture the business rules and match up the data for example a company may use tools such as clarabridge clearforest and temis to analyze large chunks of text and route key insights to appropriate business units companies also use custom built tools for the purpose though such cases are rare in one project of this kind a leading u s retail chain needed to analyze customer survey text it used a suite of tools to do information extraction text labeling business modeling and sentiment analysis the tools automate work that would otherwise have to be done by hand for instance categorizing similar groups of products and customers the retail chain gained insights on different product categories issues for each product category were further classified by factors such as price product quality associate behavior store cleanliness product availability and variety combined with the geographical information about the stores the retailer identified actionable insights to increase sales a grocery store could use a similar approach to analyze huge sets for customer sentiment data for example text analysis can group customer complaints from multiple channels phone email social survey under labels comments such as lower your prices checkout lines are too long or i love your dairy products but keep more types of cheese can be grouped and acted upon the business labels might be pricing checkout process dairy and variety without automated analysis tools and good mapping back to business process you could try to analyze such data however it would take many people and there would be subjectivity bias in interpreting the comments here if there is a bias it is uniform across the data also with automation the company can run reports like this every hours mapping analytics insights to divisions products and services leads to valuable input from business side teams on what business kpis such as a customer satisfaction index and sales volume relate to the project for example if you are doing customer sentiment analysis on social data for an online retailer the ultimate business kpi is sales effective metrics could include click to conversion rates or lead generation to sales conversion rates new data sets new toolsin addition to rethinking metrics it is also important to take a fresh look at your data sources since valuable information lies in mobile app geographic and internet of things data for example what is more an emerging and intriguing source to consider is news feed data news data can inform everyday business activities especially at the strategic level and help a company build contextual intelligence which is highly desirable for example if you are acquiring a business in a new geography you want to build intelligence about economic factors political issues and lessons learned by other companies in that locale multinationals setting up in india or china face many local issues that have to be understood in another example an auto company would want to be up to date on all news related to changes in pollution related laws in regions for which it is designing vehicles the earlier companies come to know of such changes the better human analysts can only look at so much news but today companies such as bloomberg and ravenpack offer tools that scan and organize large volumes of news content and social media posts for purposes like these as well as for financial services and stock trading in addition to new data sources companies want to examine additional data analysis methods and tools to complement traditional ones for unstructured text analysis open graph databases and nosql databases prove helpful in addition to natural language processing tools why in a nosql database data is stored as key value pairs and not in tables with predefined schema this helps in indexing unstructured data and retrieving it quickly open graph databases are all about resources linking to resources as in wikipedia s example wikipedia holds a great deal of unstructured data but a graph on top links resources this helps resolve certain issues related to handling unstructured text for example using wikipedia software tools can easily conclude that the entities barack obama and president of the u s refer to the same person for example using wikipedia software tools can easily conclude that the entities barack obama and president of the u s refer to the same person today many linked open data sources store valuable information curated from the unstructured content of wikipedia ready for business use companies can use them to obtain valuable information like honda is a competitor of toyota or toyota manufactures camry without much effort a company might deploy tools that use this knowledge to continuously track negative sentiments about its competitors or their products or positive sentiments about its own brand unstructured data surprise insightswhat kind of results can companies glean from analytics projects that include a fresh approach to kpis multiple data sets and unstructured data often unstructured data yields insights you may not envision at the start of the project consider the case of an insurance company with global presence in more than countries which operated a toll free call center to receive customer complaints after the company observed over two months that call durations grew significantly longer than expected it decided to examine the calls using analytics tools speech to text technology helped transcribe the audio calls in addition to examining the transcript analysis included non linguistic parameters like lengths of silence number of call transfers within one call and so on clustering techniques grouped like communications together and communications were mapped to services provided by the insurance company analyzing customer complaint content may not only reveal frequent customer problems but also identify business process flaws the insurance company discovered several unexpected insights not only did the technology identify the most frequent reasons for customer complaints deeper analysis revealed flaws in its process for handling new insurance policy requests the company gained actionable insights for improving that process addressable flaws in the call center operational processes also came to light adding more roi on the analytics work conquering common barrierswith analytics projects like these the smartest companies seek to make the data driven insights available across the company not just in isolated departments that is how companies move beyond incremental analytics project success to company wide business improvements as has been exemplified by companies such as procter gamble and ge potentially valuable insights will perish if stuck inside silos for example as cited above analyzing customer complaint content may not only reveal frequent customer problems but also identify business process flaws often owners of analytics projects are only concerned about a specific issue say brand reputation and do not bother with other insights that come out of the data to change this mindset and to combat cultural resistance to sharing data across organizational boundaries you need executive support from c suite leaders executives can also pave the way for moving to new kpis tied closely to business results any change to kpis can create pushback since it affects compensation for people from management to delivery teams so people need to understand the business benefit as articulated by the ceo a clear business objective will not only put new kpis in context for the team but also ease the case for proving roi in business terms privacy and compliance issues pose a final hurdle that can trip up analytics projects especially those involving unstructured data for example if a customer intended a communication call e mail to serve one purpose the company may not be able to harvest additional insight without suitable permissions in place in banking a customer communication may reveal the need for a product or service however banks face many regulations in using that information insurance companies and internal hr departments see similar restrictions around health information your company s internal privacy and compliance experts should be looped in early in the analytics project to stave off wasted efforts or possible privacy violations answering the analytics challengethe time has come to pay attention to unstructured data such as customer communication data that is being ignored in the cases of the retail chain and insurance company these brands surfaced actionable business information from their data before rivals were able to capitalize on weak spots and realized roi directly tied to business goals try to look beyond optimizing business operations by analyzing sales and revenue graphs smart analytics platforms can link structured and unstructured data about your company and its rivals to generate new insights about the why of business intelligence beyond the sales or revenue graphs unstructured data holds valuable clues to what excites or dismays your customers issues that may not have been on the radar at all combine this with public information about your competitors and the data mined from sources such as news feeds and social media and you get a fuller picture of your competitive situation faster than before companies have become experts at analyzing sales spikes and falls adding in seasonal variation the smart ones have also learned to capitalize on unstructured data for example clothing retailers in the u k jumped on the opportunity to sell blue dresses that looked similar to the one princess kate wore in a photo celebrating her engagement and later baby clothing modeled after her childrens outfits what will the next opportunity look like for apparel retailers or for any company that masters analytics technology the answer is out there ready to be analyzed in unstructured data cio com big data and analytics spending to hit

7,anyone who has followed the travails of the u s newspaper industry knows it has been in a steep decline since the rise of the web in the 1990s between and the industry s annual advertising revenue plunged from billion to billion numerous newspapers have folded there were fewer u s dailies in than in and several prominent newspaper chains have gone in and out of bankruptcy over the last two decades nonetheless for jim kennedy the future of journalism could not be brighter or more exciting because he sees technology transforming it i think the next to years will be amazing says kennedy senior vice president of strategy and enterprise development for the associated press the year old news service we will see the rebirth of the journalist the ap is one of the largest newsgathering operations in the world it is operated as a not for profit cooperative owned by the daily newspapers of the united states and serving news outlets worldwide it reported million in revenue last year kennedy has had an excellent perch from which to observe the recent evolution of the newspaper business he has been a fixture at ap since except for an month stint at the turn of the century as head of planning and product development at the wall street journal s online edition in kennedy witnessed the birth of craigslist one of many websites whose free want ads siphoned off classified ad revenue from newspapers to the tune of billion alone between and according to one estimate a year later he started the ap s first department devoted to launching digital products ap realized back then that it needed to deal with online competitors and also to start figuring out how to leverage technology to work for not against newspapers ap s latest digital initiative is one that harnesses artificial intelligence to write stories ap s latest digital initiative is one that harnesses artificial intelligence to write stories in several ap journalists alerted kennedy to a north carolina company automated insights whose ai technology was being used to write releases for the cleveland indians baseball team and sports stories for yahoo kennedy and others at ap were intrigued they put the software to a small test writing short articles on the weekly statistical performances of national football league offensive players stories ap s newspaper customers could use to supplement their own nfl coverage the technology worked i thought to myself that is the acid test kennedy remembers the point was to take a data stream and see if it could be turned it into a narrative blurb of text that looked like a human wrote it for kennedy the experiment validated three important proofs of concept the software could produce new content that ap s writers didn t have time for yet member newspapers coveted the content was indistinguishable from stories written by humans and it could be done rapidly the following year in the experiment gave ap the confidence to turn the technology loose on another kind of article ap and automated insights trained the ai program to write quarterly earnings stories on publicly held companies there are companies listed on u s stock exchanges far too many for ap s business journalists to write stories about when the firms announce their quarterly results in fact ap s business reporters wrote about such stories every three months typically only about the biggest companies apple mcdonald s and so on that newspaper readers were interested in by the end of after working to train the software to write these word articles using financial data from zacks investment research the ai was spitting out earnings stories every quarter more than times as many as was possible before importantly kennedy notes ai was not being used to take work away from journalists it supplemented their work while giving ap s daily newspaper owners more of what they wanted earnings stories covering the smaller companies in their locales companies with which their local readers had an intimate connection training the technology to write short articles about the results of sports games is next says kennedy to kennedy this is merely the beginning of how ai will help ap s journalists dramatically improve the way they gather analyze and produce news he sees ai giving the ap three big opportunities for the rest of the decade and beyond continuing to produce content that its reporters do not have the time to write giving journalists tools to see patterns and make connections from the mountains of data that have been collected about people organizations and issues and enabling new readers to get answers to specific questions about an organization company sports team government agency and so on people and issues based on ap s ability to tag items in each article at more granular levels tagging will allow ap to make our news reports more granular so that we can move it into all kinds of applications that would support vertical industry insights research use cases and the on demand consumer world kennedy explains we have an opportunity to expand to other customer segments with that in mind kennedy believes the newspaper industry s embrace of ai has just begun i predict that eventually the technology will produce more game stories in sports than humans will he says that in turn will not only result in more stories being produced but it will free up journalists to get the story behind the story focusing on the more complex articles that readers crave but take more time to produce we have to free our people to produce the kinds of content that no one else has concludes kennedy robert seamans new york university stern school of business and feng zhu harvard business school responses to entry in multi sided markets the impact of craigslist on local newspapers management science november accessed june,case study why artificial intelligence is a big part of ap s future
8,why is a strong analytics effort key to competitive advantage for banking and financial services companies as banking and financial services companies search for new revenue streams analytics projects let them deliver more personalized products in a shorter time to market analytics help banks present the customer with the right product at the right time via the right channels also thanks to the growing body of application programming interfaces apis with the ability to connect disparate data sets banks can create added services for existing customers often using financial tech companies as sales channel partners machine learning combined with analytics teaches banks much about customer behavior and preferences so the banks can continuously learn and fine tune analytical models to optimize products and services plus optimize the cost of offering products in various channels cloud based analytics platforms give banks flexibility and elasticity to work with big data workloads at high velocity and reap business value faster what types of new data sources are banking and financial services companies using to wring more value from data analysis projects given the valuable data now residing in sources ranging from social media posts to mobile applications banks need to acquire more data types from more channels for example banks work with a growing amount of nosql data to harness value from semi structured data from sources such as website clickstream tracking reports weather and news data product reviews and social media posts hadoop tools can help banks glean insights from unstructured data such as call center customer inquiries video clips image scans and text messages to deal with these data types efficiently the unified data architecture approach has become popular this lets the bank create a unified semantic layer for internal and external data using apis to deliver the data to various business groups based on need what are the biggest worries for bfs companies around analytics right now first data management is a key concern for bfs organizations as banks use big data tools to analyze data in increasing variety velocity and volume governance and data quality become key challenges second banks must meet significant legal risk and compliance requirements on the security auditing retention and backup of analytic data customer data privacy and security as well as granular security for employees also pose key worries as companies explore wider use of analytics finally bfs companies are struggling to find talented people who can transform analytics data into actionable business data what is holding back better analytics roi for these companies several factors hold bfs companies back from realizing more roi on analytics projects at some companies federated business structures and a lack of accountability cause delays in reaping roi a unified framework that includes various business processes and points teams toward the same business goals is essential additionally bfs companies struggle with deciding which key performance indicators kpis are critical for managing analytics projects and evaluating analytics project roi until roi measurement matures banks will struggle to demonstrate business impact within bfs companies a great deal of data remains cordoned off it still does not flow through analytics tools or influence business decisions also some banks remain far away from using big data analytics machine learning or real time analytics because their infrastructure concerns or governance data privacy and security worries hinder progress these banks struggle exploring how to monetize analytics finally self service analytics tools have not become a reality for most business users yet the democratization of data where people at all levels of a bfs company can access huge amounts of data and derive insights has not arrived because self service tools are still emerging until those tools mature further apis can help banks connect analytics data to day to day business processes and automate decision making,banking and financial services analytics for competitive advantage
9,what is the shelf life of the journeys you have mapped out for your customers how long will they be relevant to their wants and needs is it two years one year six months it is a lot shorter than you think the customer journey maps that companies use to attract win and keep customers degrade quickly because customer preference and purchase criteria change rapidly how fast do customer expectations change in a tcs analytics study on wireless communication providers we discovered that in early customer choice was driven by contract by march t mobile touted as the uncarrier had obliterated contracts which shortly thereafter ceased to be a prime purchase criterion any customer journey designed around the contract experience expired in that quarter and customers continued changing their wireless provider purchase criteria in this research covering millions of social media posts and two years of customer behavior we observed that the criteria customers used to choose among wireless providers changed fast some rising pricing data devices such as iphones others dropping contracts coverage generic phones they changed on a monthly basis clearly if a company creates static or rigid customer journeys their sell by dates will come and go just as fast we found that customer criteria are not just variable by time they differ by geography while wireless phone service customers in atlanta focused on coverage and download speeds customers in oklahoma city were up in arms about what they perceived as data capping setting monthly limits on how much digital data they could use at a preferable rate at the same time customers in miami and houston were more likely to choose providers based on international access and coverage companies of all types not just wireless carriers need to pay heed here to respond to the rapid pace of customer change companies need to measure the customer experience frequently if not continuously across all channels they also must be operationally adept enough to change as fast as the customer does adjusting at the speed of market shiftsduring the holiday season in the previously mentioned study figure the highest number of twitter discussions in the southeast u s were on down payments for phones the next most frequent topics were monthly fees upgrade fees and fee waivers responding quickly one provider eliminated down payments on some iphone models for the holidays another provider noting that upgrade discussions were spiking in texas georgia and alabama over the holiday season offered new phone purchases with lower monthly payments in those regions it also eliminated upgrade fees for certain programs and began offering shorter contract terms figure customer experience changes over a three month periodover the fall of the holiday season the criteria customers used to choose among wireless service providers shifted on a monthly basis to stay competitive all companies must build the internal capability to alter those customer journeys not in a year or in a matter of weeks but potentially in days and hours researching customer needs creating solutions to address them managing all the possible customer touchpoints optimizing them for each customer segment and finally creating a customer experience that encourages the target customer to buy and remain loyal must become a continuous activity for companies not a one off unfortunately most companies make a single herculean effort to map a set of customer journeys their designs are often informed by gut instinct and internal anecdotes which can skew those journeys to whatever hot issues may be affecting one department or another not by data then these firms spend months and years building out the capabilities for those journeys however they do not design them with the capacity for rapid change nor do they frequently monitor customer preferences and experience to understand what to change where to change it and when customer journey maps need to be dynamic processes systems and even people must have plasticity the four drivers of fast changing customer expectationscustomer preferences change more quickly than businesses expect largely because of four factors information customers inarguably are better informed today free and open market information that allows customers to compare prices at every stage of the journey is one of the most disruptive capabilities to come with the mobile internet social media and consumer forums are becoming more important in all phases of the customer journey researching consideration purchasing and servicing social influence the primary influence on the customer purchasing decision no longer comes from the companies they buy from it does not come from advertising it comes from personal recommendations and peer reviews word of mouth recommendations have been industrialized through social media they are not one to one they are many to many with their impact magnified exponentially indeed of shoppers rely on social networks to make purchase decisions according to a study by the chief marketing officer council and lithium the purchases of about four out of five u s social media users are influenced by their friends posts 4technology innovation the pace of technology change has become faster and customers are adopting new software hardware and functionality all the time this changes their expectations of your technology years ago banks were slow to unveil new atm features but today new mobile phones and features are constantly entering the market the result for banks many customers expect them to leverage those new features and functions even in their atms market influence customers interactions with other industries are influencing their expectations of how your business should operate previously you monitored your competition to stay competitive what happened in another industry retail for instance had little or no impact on insurance or banking but every business is now operating on the same or similar online platforms almost every company has a website a mobile app a facebook page a chat interface etc so if one industry or company eliminates contracts allows mobile payments offers day returns and sends geo targeted coupons your customers will know about it they will also expect you to do the same or something similar regardless of your industry segment this is true of business models too customers adopting uber lyft and airbnb approaches to managing the customer journey are expecting similar models from other companies to stay competitive businesses must monitor every entity in their customers ecosystem of products and brands do you have a degree days a year view of your customer because customers are dynamic a business needs to continuously loop customer feedback into the customer journey without that feedback loop no customer journey can succeed for long it will quickly fall behind customer expectations according to forrester research most companies make the following customer experience analytics mistakes do not regularly ask customers about the quality of their interactions77 do not track customer experience drivers in their organizations which makes it difficult to know how to change even if change were possible do not track how customer experiences affect business results which makes it difficult to get leadership buy in to invest in improving and changing the customer experience do not share the customer experience findings they do gather with employees or leadership thereby effectively guaranteeing that the customer experience they provide will neither improve nor change businesses have responded to the dissonance in what customers want and what their companies offer by investing a great deal of time and money into creating seamless and consistently branded customer experiences across all channels however companies tend to monitor those channels inside out deriving metrics from internal key performance indicators kpis they also typically report those metrics channel by channel for example web reports store reports call center reports even though they have designed a holistic omnichannel customer journey siloed channel analytics can be very misleading during focus group customer interviews a cable company discovered that customers who dropped its service cited poor service however it also found that customers were satisfied with each channel in the case of onboarding there were many touchpoints phone calls service visits web forms emails and so on and each showed satisfaction that was pretty good but over the course of the whole customer journey satisfaction fell to not so good in summary each touchpoint worked well but the whole customer experience did not because while the company was focused on optimizing touchpoints customers engaged with the company through integrated cross channel journeys the entire customer journey turned out to be less than the sum of its channel parts to manage and modify a customer journey companies need to monitor customer experience holistically however amid all the hoopla over analytics marketers still distrust data they reportedly depend on data for only about one tenth of the decisions they make about customers and according to a ceb survey of marketers at fortune companies data based decisions trail conversations with managers and colleagues expert advice and one off customer interactions 8how to know when your customer journey starts growing stalehere are some signals that your customer journey might be wearing a bit thin customers shift channels frequently in their interactions with your firm this indicates frustration in your channel experience customers seek and provide information about your company or product from sources you do not control or to which you do not contribute this indicates that your information and guidance is not complete useful or in the worst case scenario not credible customers go off the map creating their own journeys from outside your company this indicates the people processes interactions and information you are providing in your journey map are not sufficient or dynamic enough to meet their needs your journey is too rigid customers bouncing from channel to channel is not a sign your omnichannel strategy is working our analysis shows that while brands are omnichannel their customers are not in a tcs analysis of retail banking channels we discovered that customers only switch channels when their preferred one does not meet their expectations we call this channel inertia accordingly when your customers hop from one channel to another this should signal that the previous channel they preferred is no longer meeting their needs and has to adapt if you offer avenues for customers to resolve issues but they post complaints and seek product information from sources you do not control or contribute to then that is a signal your journey is stale in one case a cable company provided and responded to customers via many traditional and digital service channels still we found its customers went to amazon for modems and wifi range extenders then used amazon s equipment review area to complain about and discuss the cable company s customer service not just the products they were buying from amazon this indicated customer problems were not being resolved within the channels the company provided this can be part of a larger trend that indicates your journey is stale while off track journeys can be opportunities for companies to meet their customer where their journey takes them if customers research shop buy and seek service outside of your journey map then your journey map is not working for them the impact of out of date customer journey maps can be severe the cmo council has found that customers are more willing than ever to ditch a brand for another that offers a better experience what is more almost half of cmos say they are not realizing the full revenue potential of their customers and report they need to do more to connect their internal processes with the changing customer experience only of these cmos felt their companies delivered a customer experience that fulfilled their brand s promise 10how to keep up with the accelerating pace of customer expectationsso what can companies do to keep their customer journeys competitive the story of a large retailer is instructive here earlier this decade with a customer base composed mostly of women with children the chain wanted to bring mobile technology and social media into its customer journey however it first needed to know exactly how its customers used them after using crm surveys and social analytics the retailer realized it was dealing with four unique behavioral segments we will simply refer to them as segments a b c and d let us take a look at segment c by collecting data on each segment s mobile and social behaviors along each stage of the customer journey the retailer discovered of segment c used a mobile device to shop for deals many also used catalogs and discussed products with other mothers through social media channels the awareness stage was often kicked off by an sms message from family and friends informing shoppers in segment c of an upcoming special event a birthday a graduation and so on she then visited the retailer s mobile website and searched the catalog she browsed the store s shelves used her pc to compare prices on the web asked family and friends about options and deals checked out product reviews on her mobile while she was in the store and on her pc when she returned home in the selection phase she filled multiple carts from competitors but often abandoned her online carts coupons and point of sale add ons were critical to segment c customers in the purchase stage and sometimes she would put off a purchase until a better deal emerged based on this level of persona profiling and the associated customer journeys the retailer invested in more than four dozen digital programs to develop the capabilities for improving engagement with all these moms these programs included enhancing mobile search capabilities and creating a mobile app with an embedded loyalty program that offered coupons and calendar reminders of special events in the shopper s children s lives the retailer built out its in store wifi it launched an intense sms marketing program with sms coupons sms shipping alerts and sms abandoned cart alerts while instituting an easier return program all that happened earlier this decade but much has changed since then in mobile social technology processes functions shopper preferences and behavior in the segment c shoppers awareness of need phase of the customer journey mobile web and shopping apps have become more popular than sms fewer customers are visiting stores and more are making purchases from mobile phones more internet users of all types are on tablet computers and fewer use pcs had the retailer stuck with a picture of its customer journeys taken just a few years ago it would have had challenges the lesson here is that companies must monitor their customer experience kpis as often as needed in their industry to ensure the customer journeys and the initiatives based on them are still on track we say in their industry because our customer research across industries shows us that the pace of customer change varies by industry you need to begin with test data collection and analytics to benchmark how frequently key decision criteria is changing in your industry s key segments benchmarking your unique industry customer change cycle will also inform many other aspects of your customer experience efforts how often can you successfully introduce new features and functions how often can customers consume new messaging what is the right timing for new product releases what changes most frequently so where should you prepare and operationalize for change is it product messaging pricing or service deploying dynamic customer journey mapsunderstanding the change is the first requirement building systems processes and training people to adapt quickly to customer change is the second companies will need to shift to dynamic customer journey mapping and its attendant technologies to adjust them quickly a great example of such mapping can be seen at u k supermarket giant tesco tesco continually analyzes its million loyalty card customers purchasing data using what it calls recency frequency value analysis it scores customers on how often they shop the items they purchase and their spending with this analysis tesco creates personal experiences for different shoppers customizing offerings for each segment while tesco primarily focused on dynamic loyalty personalization the end game is to be able to adjust any aspect any step in the journey based on customer experience analytics dynamic customer journey

purchase criteria will be artificial intelligence and machine learning for example a media company with high customer turnover revamped its analytics using a neural network to predict which customers were preparing to leave so it could address the problem proactively the analytics accuracy in predicting churn was between and and every percentage point of churn reduction added millions of dollars to the company s bottom line 12the need for more intelligent applications and advice is nowhere more acute than in customer experience creating an agile customer journeycompanies that can change their messaging offerings pricing and channels at the speed their customer needs change will be winners companies must take two big steps to establish such agile customer journeys step create an infrastructure people process platform and data responsive to the insight you retrieve for example by linking data directly from search to operations google can change an ad almost instantly without human facilitation step monitor behavior at the pace of change and feed insights directly into action google updates ad positioning continuously according to an ads relevance to an individual search the better the position the higher the click through rate producing more revenue for google and the businesses buying ads this is a virtuous circle that creates value for both parties because google automatically maps its updates to the changing customer journey how do you know your customers are changing faster than you are you are losing customers and market share that is a dead giveaway that you are not meeting their needs do not wait until they have left to make a change perhaps you do not know how often they change you thought you did but that was yesterday they have changed since then have you this a challenge that every business needs to address if the customer journey it designed yesterday does not meet the customer experience needs and purchase criteria of its customers today

10,the transition of enterprise apps to the cloud model has moved from an if question to a how question how to do it quickly and expertly erp software leaders such as oracle and sap are squarely focused on giving customers the right product and service mix for their cloud transitions and for their digital business transformations while these are mission critical applications at the heart of the business transition speed is of the essence as businesses transform to digital enterprises the lengthy erp software implementations of the past do not fly business model changes product innovations and customer service improvements have to happen quickly the company that ignores this reality will watch its rivals both established companies and nimble up and comers race right by for companies to capitalize on cloud based enterprise systems they must significantly reduce the time it took in the past to implement traditional enterprise systems however one size or approach still does not suit all companies in the cloud environment many use hybrid solutions that combine on premises and cloud tools and even within cloud companies have the option of public versus private cloud model approaches the right tools and techniques help companies ensure successful fast implementations of cloud based enterprise systems and harmonize them as needed with existing installed systems among the key elements for companies seeking cloud transition speed a new approach to gathering requirements and doing testing a willingness to use automation tools and standardized processes and a willingness to look at cloud tools as part of a holistic technology strategy that includes mobile and analytics tools leaders of today s effective enterprise software projects stay focused on digital business goals and seek out ways to reach them faster where traditional approaches fall shortcompanies are moving away from the on premises model for erp apps and to the cloud model for several reasons related to business digital transformation in the past the best product at the right price typically won the marketplace but today speed to market and agility win as customers press for continuous innovation thus companies face unprecedented pressure to transform business processes and business models and do so at high speed this kind of marketplace speed creates heightened business expectations for erp software tools at a time when amazon can make hundreds of changes to its core business systems in a week business teams want more from their own erp systems it s reputation as the department of no must evolve for a digital business to thrive companies also have a newfound need for agility when companies free up cash by shifting from the capex intensive on premises it model to an opex model with cloud services this adds flexibility in turn this flexibility can speed a company s time to market for new products and services finally a digital business seeks to share the newest data even real time data broadly throughout the organization to enable faster decision making yesterday s erp tools were not designed with that mindset however broad access to data goes hand in hand with cloud and mobile technologies for all these reasons companies are taking a critical look at which cloud based erp tools could help them solve key business problems a fresh approachhow are companies embarking on this significant software transition with an eye to speed keys to a successful enterprise software cloud transition include a new approach to requirements openness to automation speedier testing attention to data migration and tool coexistence iterating during software development work and taking a holistic technology approach focused on business goals for many companies the solution involves a hybrid cloud approach for example involving a customer s private cloud oracle provided cloud services and third party cloud services in another example sap is making it easier for customers to run its s 4hana apps on public cloud services the right planning and tools can ensure cloud based tools and remaining on premises tools coexist productively let us delve into the keys to success starting with a new approach to the requirements process in the traditional on premises software world this process starts with gathering requirements from customers and trying to map to the on premises product to those business wishes in the cloud world the requirements process is product led fast companies choose to use best in class business processes available via cloud tools instead of doing tons of customization work for example u s financial company td bank did a project to solve hr related business problems the company s hr information was too distributed since regional hr apps kept data siloed also each region had its own hr processes creating inefficiencies seeking to reduce tco around hr the company chose to move to oracle hcm cloud the company utilized oracle hcm s standardized hr processes for workforce compensation saving implementation time embedded analytics helped the company define individual software dashboards for various employee roles next companies should look for opportunities to use automation tools and pre configured tools wherever possible for example business process frameworks for particular industries automation can significantly speed the configuration process doing tasks that once required weeks of hands on work from it for example south african telecomm company cell c transitioned from on premises oracle software to cloud based versions in with two business goals enabling an online education curriculum to improve employee engagement and thus decrease turnover rates and shifting software licensing costs from capex to opex for implementation speed cell c used a tcs configuration tool to realize a to reduction in implementation time compared to industry average benchmarks from oracle and a business process improvement as it got rid of extraneous business processes pre configured transition tools can also assist companies in industry verticals when there is a functional gap between the oracle on premises and cloud products for example a tool for employee engagement plugs into oracle hcm saas allowing bi directional communication with employees in another example you may need to add a procurement solution for tasks like comparing products using information from social media and product websites for companies moving to a tool like oracle hcm cloud it is important to know where such functional gaps are in order to address them and keep the project s go live date on track tcs has pre built solutions to fill in these functional gaps built on oracle paas erp implementations involve considerable testing of course but automation tools can help here as well for example to shorten the testing cycle on oracle implementations an automated testing tool can cut a four to six week testing cycle to a few days to two weeks another benefit of automated test tools in a cloud implementation oracle offers customers new feature functionality in small drops every two to three months with each drop the customer has to test again to ensure compatibility automated test scripts speed up the work the same is true for oracle patches data migration and on premises tool co existence matter significantly to companies pursuing speedy transitions getting data from existing systems into the new cloud based system is perhaps the most underestimated task in these projects requiring much time energy and effort companies should seek opportunities to speed repetitive tasks here in particular for example a retailer that was rapidly adding stores in asia used tcs quickconfig utility to reduce the time needed to add a new store into the company s sap erp system from eight to nine days to a few hours cloud erp transitions often happen in pieces targeting focused digital business problems companies do not have to tackle all the data at once in td bank s case mentioned earlier the company wanted to keep using peoplesoft software for all other hr functions other than workforce compensation so the tcs oracle cloud integration layer was used to integrate the oracle hcm cloud tool with peoplesoft tools giving the bank a fruitful on premises cloud tools coexistence in another example global glory an atm manufacturer sought an oracle cloud based tool but only for supply chain work the company uses on premises j d edwards software tools for all other erp functions to save time during this project global glory leveraged tcs pre built adapters built on oracle s integrated cloud services on paas for on premises products like j d edwards and peoplesoft oracle s ics offering lacks the pre built adapters pre built equaled time saved for the company where are the time sinks on your cloud tools migration roadmap take a close look at what preconfigured and automated tools exist to conquer those issues make way for iterationalong with these keys to success companies that achieve speedy transitions to cloud tools use some elements of the agile development approach not a sequential waterfall approach iteration is central to the agile approach as part of this effort business teams should see the end stage goal for the software very early in the development cycle in the old world months or years of work would happen before business users saw a skeleton of the software interface that they would be using today business goals change regulations change people change too quickly for that old world development model the business could get stuck with a big disconnect by the time software development work ends an iterative approach allows development teams to adjust rapidly to changes looking ahead to the future companies will have access to additional techniques to further speed such implementations for example visualization technology can help companies with testing assumptions about erp implementations tcs in concert with academic researchers is experimenting with some companies to do simulations of erp implementations and gamify the simulations here is how it works teams use an erp simulator tool to construct a business model say for selling a product like cereal the simulator fast forwards quarters and years to show how each business model choice plays out for the business the team that produces the most revenue and profit and least leftover inventory wins the exercise in a short amount of time a business team can visualize how an erp plan will succeed or fail it is easy to envision both startups and established companies finding value from such simulations dealing with speed bumpseven companies that commit to trying tools and techniques like the ones explored above can face significant speed hurdles during transitions to cloud based erp tools first companies can not underestimate the importance of user experience to the success of these projects usability can still be a factor with erp tools with sap for example the user interface for cloud based tools is still in transition and can pose a barrier for quick user acceptance of the software in erp the focus traditionally has been on business processes user experience played a subordinate role but today in the age of mobile and handheld devices we all expect more from software tools and their ui that is another reason to ensure business users see what they are getting for ui early in the development process second companies can suffer from a lack of business focus during cloud transition projects the companies that fail at erp implementations are typically the ones that try to do everything all at once for the business the companies that succeed are the ones who know where to focus td bank for example zeroed in on inefficient hr processes and siloed hr data and correcting those problems before they became a competitive operational or financial liability companies need a clear roadmap of desired digital business outcomes so the erp plan can be matched up to it and executed accordingly this also requires true respect for technology project scope if you keep the scope fluid the quick path to the business outcome can vanish third moving erp tools to a cloud model requires a great deal of change management inside the organization given the mission critical status of these tools support from the top proves crucial the ceo needs to invest time to make sure everyone understands how this erp software change furthers the company business strategy additionally transitions of this sort may create significant cultural upheaval within the it department which cannot be ignored it s role changes in the cloud based model offloading administration tasks and freeing up time for business innovation work but what exactly does the new saas product handle what does it handle what does your systems integrator handle for some companies it s role is still evolving strong executive support for it s role in the digital business transformation is mandatory finally companies that make this transition quickly fight the urge to customize too much this represents a big change for managing erp tools for decades business has dictated requirements and customization was widely expected now in the interest of speed companies opt for more standardized business processes how do you know where to draw the lines around what still deserves to be customized some companies will set limits around customization tied to revenue for example setting rules such as if the business process affects less than million in revenue we will not customize it if the business process affects more we will review it for possible customization but the bottom line is that any customization requires a strong business rationale acting on the big picturetoday s default business model is a digital business model thus to be competitive companies must take a holistic view of technology and shape a clear roadmap to the digital model cloud transitions and cloud strategy should be considered integral to the overall digital business journey winning companies consider mobility and analytics along with cloud transitions and not as an afterthought additionally business user expectations of enterprise software tools will only grow and your rivals can and will use their ability to move fast with these tools as a competitive advantage so it is time to let go of older ideas about the requirements process testing and data migration that will slow down implementations use automation tools as much as possible and stress an iterative approach as you explore where any functional gaps exist between the on premises and cloud erp tools seek out data analysis tools to solve related business problems for example during this part of its cloud migration work chip manufacturer knowles solved a quality issue where faults on chips were surfacing too late in the production process by staying ruthlessly focused on digital business goals companies can make the most of critical software transitions,accelerated change getting faster at implementing enterprise systems
11,the competitive digital business landscape is forcing organizations to become better at recognizing the workforce skills they will need well before they need them when companies become reactive in filling key jobs they have a hard time securing critical talent at the moment of need the result is they lose out on key hires to companies that have articulated their talent requirements however to keep good people and identify the new crop that companies will need hr executives will have to let go of many traditional hiring and retention practices–methods established at a time when detailed up to date information on employee value attitudes and company job needs were either missing or locked up in file cabinets stuffed with paper records how can big companies better anticipate the next wave of skills they will need and retain their rising stars amidst intense competition for the best people in this article i will explain methods that tcs with more than employees around the world today nearly six times the number of years ago and other companies have used to retain the best people as well as hire new ones before there is a run on them my advice is that many companies need to rethink traditional ideas about recruiting and hiring stress the business value of internal training and make the hr organization more agile hr executives in particular have an unprecedented opportunity to help business unit managers solve two of their biggest talent challenges retaining their most valuable employees and determining what new skills they will soon need before competitors do the talent crunchacross industries and around the world big companies have truly been in a war for talent since the great recession began to recede about seven years ago a key reason for the acute talent shortages in certain domains in addition to the rebounding world economy is that digital technologies have been redefining jobs in every business function let us consider the marketing function five years ago many companies did not have marketers heading areas such as social media search engine optimization mobile applications marketing analytics and online customer communities today those positions are commonplace and often go begging for talent ann lewnes chief marketing officer at billion1 marketing software firm adobe systems inc put it this way the rise of new digital technologies has caused upheaval for many industries and the marketing profession has been in the eye of that storm too adobe s survey of more than marketers and e commerce professionals across industries and around the world found they have seen more changes in marketing in the last two years than in the last years in addition of the hottest skills of linkedin found four of the top ten were related to marketing marketing campaign management seo mobile development and user interface design 3digital technologies have also created acute skills shortages in the it function there has been a run on talent in such hot technology domains as artificial intelligence internet of things and big data and analytics the market for a key digital business role analytics and big data remains particularly hot as evidenced by a high number of candidates switching jobs in of analytics professionals and data scientists switched jobs overall of u s employers and of global employers had difficulties filling job vacancies due to talent shortages 5many conventional hr tactics and tools were not designed for the pace of digital business today s workforce predictive analytics software can help companies cope to an extent companies are using it to predict what skills they will need they can be proactive in talent acquisition and development to plan the basics of recruiting training and infrastructure development accurate forecasting based on predicted attrition rates and business growth forecasts for departments helps a company prepare for growth and predict future talent needs but using this software is table stakes not a competitive differentiator so how do large organizations hold onto their best people how do they identify new skills they will need just over the horizon the hr practices of one of america s biggest banks wells fargo are instructive how wells fargo goes beyond traditional hr tactics and toolssome companies are thinking more critically and creatively about how to apply these tools take wells fargo co america s third largest bank while the bank uses analytics to assess the impact of employee turnover but it focuses on the quality of turnover–that is who exactly is leaving the organization because all employees are different we cannot count their turnover the same said kathy doan vice president of community banking hr insights and analytics whose team advises senior hr leaders at a unit of wells fargo that has more than employees if you think about it what will hurt a baseball club more losing a cy young award winning pitcher or losing a designated hitter we have business leaders interested in applying this quality of turnover concept to identify areas that have high attrition risk accurate forecasting based on predicted attrition rates and business growth forecasts for departments helps a company prepare for growth and predict future talent needs doan advises hr executives to use predictive modeling to assess which of their company s valued employees are ready to leave that in turn requires using a range of data for example how long they have been in their jobs their satisfaction score on the company engagement survey and their job performance as she wrote would it not be great if you knew that an employee who has been in his or her job for six months has an overall satisfaction score of on the engagement survey and is meeting of their productivity goals has a chance of leaving the company wells fargo is also exploring the use of text mining of social media to predict when an employee may leave the company despite the turbulence in the banking industry wells fargo was the 10th most valuable american company by market value and the most valuable bank at the end of clearly it is succeeding in the digital era in companies like wells fargo hr has become an invaluable adviser to senior management about talent especially about who is likely to leave but who must be retained and the new skills the organization will require next that requires supplying the necessary data tools and executive support talent approaches that workso how can your company get there here are several key strategies for winning the talent race developing your employeesthe best companies we have seen at retaining talent and discerning upcoming skill needs stress internal development and cross training the reason is simple they can kill two birds with one stone by training the people who already work for them these companies are more likely to retain valuable employees who are looking for new learning opportunities at the same time they begin the search for people with new key skills internally rather than externally in other words these companies check first to see if they can groom their own developing new skills in employees is a key employee retention tool rotate people from project to project to experience new technologies vertical industries and cultural environments such an approach develops people in a holistic manner for a digital business this requires good communication between leaders and their teams in order to understand individual goals and career options exactly how do hr leaders make internal skills development effective companies continue to need the traditional classroom style programs however more and more they need to train people through online learning tools they allow employees to learn around the clock from wherever they are to address specific knowledge gaps or emerging technology skills experience is just as important people need to practice what they have learned if they will not immediately be deployed to use the knowledge create an internal project where they can practice the new material also develop partner alliances wherein you can feed talent through the partner s pipeline to practice new skills screening people for their ability to continually learn and other soft skillsif the efforts described above sound like a big commitment to internal training and development rest assured that they are and they are more than just a financial commitment they also require senior business and hr executives to shift their thinking about key competencies that is our second key talent strategy hiring people for their ability to embrace continual learning today s digital businesses must prioritize hiring people who not only have the right skills and knowledge but also show a proclivity to learn new skills and knowledge that has become crucial at a time when digital technologies are dramatically reducing the lifespan of knowledge and skills in other words much conventional wisdom does not remain wise as long as it used to other soft skills attitude emotional intelligence maturity and the ability to work in a collaborative environment are more important than ever at a time when business models shift frequently and new initiatives launch at high speed such personal attributes and aptitude should have a greater weight in hiring decisions than specific skills screening more rigorouslyapplying equal screening weight for both hard and soft skills is crucial today so has conducting more rigorous background checks which is the third talent strategy for example in addition to traditional screening a growing number of organizations are going online to check out the social media postings of potential employees in the u s nearly four out of ten companies used social media in to screen potential employees more than double the number in according to the society for human resource management 11bringing brand management to campusour fourth strategy is one your marketers will embrace strengthening your company s brand at colleges and universities every company today needs a brand image that makes college graduates want to come and join them large companies that have been around for decades compete against venture capital funded firms whose digital products are often the envy of new members of the workforce while your company may not be able to tap the cool factor that such startups can offer you can capitalize on other strengths one is building a presence on campuses that long predates the days you recruit there offer learning materials to the universities for use in class it is beneficial not only for your future hires to have this knowledge but also for the industry workforce as a whole establishing labs within universities as tcs has done in india and at stanford carnegie mellon and other universities in the u s also builds a company s reputation with the university community including potential new hires and their professors and mentors procter gamble has long done this with universities in its headquarters state of ohio to feed its pipeline of talent so has statistics software company sas with north carolina state university near its headquarters in cary the focus of the sas n c state research partnership includes cyber security big data text analytics data visualization and sensors and health monitoring technologies all highly sought after employment skills as companies seek to attract retain and continually invest in possible university recruits raising visibility is crucial some companies use hackathons and contests they are not just for technology recruits for example tcs organizes several kinds of hackathons and contests for predicting product reliability and constructing business cases the enginex contest primarily for mechanical engineering students is aimed at solving problems in a factory or in product development in the u s nearly four out of ten companies used social media in to screen potential employees more than double the number in gamified learning and hiring processes can also help tcs has a campus commune portal where students join and can create communities around common interests as on other social networks with tcs experts available to discuss topics or case studies in the tcs aspire program new hires get gamified material as they prepare to join tcs where they earn badges for milestones using digital technology to hire and screenhiring has become a high tech enterprise companies that are digital businesses or running fast to become one must root out hiring inefficiencies for instance social networks such as linkedin will make much of today s human scanning of resumes obsolete in a few years you cannot only spot industry domain knowledge but also sense whether a person s history and goals culturally fit with your organization is social media a key hiring tool for your company if not it must become one additionally businesses must pay closer attention to using analytics tools if your company has poor business analytics it is hard for hr to see how the organization will grow in the future what skills it has and what skills it will need many hr departments have risen to this challenge one is the billion u k based consumer goods company unilever ceo paul polman insists that business analytics and hr analytics should be tightly married given the company s ambitious sales growth targets doubling revenue unilever s chief hr officer doug baillie sees such alignment as a distinctive strength as he explained in a recent industry association white paper we have spent an enormous amount of time examining whether we have the talent engine to sustain an billion euros revenue business … this is one of the essential roles hr plays in the business by ensuring any gaps in the skills talent or culture across the business that might harm our billion euro aspirations are covered to unilever designing a talent strategy to help execute its growth strategy has been powerful marketing the brand broadly as a great place workthe college campus is not the only place for companies to create a strong employer brand they should use other channels as well conference speaking is one and an industry alliance partnership is another along the same lines pay attention to the message your own website sends to possible hires it may be highly attractive to customers but is it as appealing to future employees in addition to traditional hiring techniques such as employee referrals still an important tool investigate emerging ones for instance can you use a platform where candidates can present themselves and discuss their interest in a role using a short video clip finally consider using innovation hubs as a way to draw prized talent say around robotics or iot skills general motors uses four u s innovation centers to draw it talent especially from local universities part of the lure is the chance to work with emerging technologies and digital business projects 14a decade ago a number of big companies such as unilever p g and shell started focusing as much on their employer brand as they had for years on their customer brand according to the employer branding firm universum since then as the firm points out social media has given employees the ability to broadcast what it is really like to work at a certain company this means companies must pay far more attention to engaging with employees and making them advocates barriers to successwhat are the common mistakes companies make as they try to improve their talent game many companies see the value in doing cross training fewer actually execute it well if you cross train someone and do not put that knowledge in action the training becomes useless companies must find ways to help employees apply the new skills second companies need strong executive support for training and tweaking hiring practices for example if you are hiring for curiosity rather than for skills the ceo must stress the value of quick learners as critical to company s digital goals this helps fight cultural resistance third many of us have watched companies focus on hiring at the expense of retention but retention is more crucial than ever to keep valued employees companies must offer multiple career paths along with leadership development opportunities coaching and mentoring are key to retention the best companies personally connect with talented individuals empathize with them and give them exposure to the right levels of leadership to showcase their potential as future leaders corporate social responsibility csr programs can help too participating in social programs such as community development work has consistently proven to boost an employer s brand with employees recruits notice csr efforts some weigh a company s csr commitments when deciding where to work according to one study in demand analytics and big data professionals are showing an increasing interest in csr another study found out 17hr s future a digital business partnerin the future while automation tools will help with the transactional aspects of hr the people aspect of hr will not go away today and tomorrow much hr activity coaching critiquing identifying rising leaders is done by the business line managers themselves hr provides necessary training and support for these managers more than ever hr should not be seen as an island but as a partner to the business teams yet hr must also continue to improve its own processes for hiring and retaining valued employees take a lesson from the agile iterative approach at startups the hr organization of a big company should constantly evaluate itself is a particular hiring or retention approach still providing value to the organization if not kill it quickly constantly question how your hr team s talent strategies benefit the business and continue to improve or discard them to improve results the hr departments that help companies identify secure motivate and retain the talent they need in the years ahead will be considered key engines of growth in the most

12,for some time many senior executives have focused on providing superior customer experiences through innovative combinations of bricks and clicks they tell us their goal is to provide a cx that is better than or at least on a par with their leading competitors it s a laudable target even if it has eluded most for decades but what they don t realize is that they may be chasing the wrong benchmarks the next big cx breakthrough is more likely to come from outside their walls and digital channels than from within them examples abound of new entrants that revolutionize the cx standard in an industry disrupting the competitive status quo and quickly capturing market share an outsider a silicon valley startup named uber used an app to create a revolutionary cx in the taxi industry which well established players are still struggling to match a computer maker apple used mobile checkouts in store experts the genius bar and onsite seminars to reinvent the cx in consumer electronics retailing two software executives created netflix s mail and later streaming services for movies sounding the death knell of the video rental store cx these examples show why company leaders must look beyond their industry s borders in search of new cx models to do this they must focus more on the outcomes their customers are seeking and less on how they and their current competitors are delivering those outcomes the currency of cx is outcomestoday companies more than ever need to consider the outcomes that customers desire in dealing with them the many new experiential options enabled by digital technologies and social media are causing customers to question the outcomes that their current suppliers provide today customers set their expectations based upon interaction and consumption of products and services with lots of other companies in any given industry by outcomes we mean the customers goal or desired result in doing business with you for example a customer outcome might be to simplify a complex task it s one reason why quicken loan s rocket mortgage which can finance a home purchase in less than minutes has taken off rocket mortgage accounted for billion of the billion in home loans that quicken funded in which would make it one of the largest mortgage companies in the u s another outcome is the need to receive a product or service with less hassle a reason why millions of us now use uber and lyft rather than stand in long taxi lines or jockey for position to flag down cabs on busy corners other outcomes might include a less contentious shopping experience think carmax in buying used autos or fast easy installation of new purchases e g best buy s geek squad such outcomes are always a value to the end customer and at the moment of need the burgeoning number of financial technology startups is a notable manifestation of this trend in retail banking customers are abandoning neighborhood banks for internet based banks in commercial banking customers are questioning the value of relationship managers across consumer corporate and institutional banking sectors customers are asking is my financial provider getting me the results i need or is there a better way to achieve them companies need to think about cx from a customer outcome based perspective and then look at the best practices of companies outside their industry to reinvent how they deliver those outcomes some executives including joe foley chief marketing officer of unum group an insurance company with billion in annual revenue are already doing this today customers set their expectations based upon interaction and consumption of products and services with lots of other companies in any given industry foley told forbes in it s really set by what they ve come to expect across the universal spectrum of customer service in their personal lives 4understanding the outcomes that customers desire is not always a straightforward task but fundamentals basic truths about customer outcomes exist across the spectrum of cx possibilities that can help executives define the outcomes that matter most to their company s customers four cx truthsthere are four truths about delivering superlative cx that apply to every industry today and for the foreseeable future not all customers want the same experience but all might want a similar outcome the outcomes customers desire are shaped by their distinctive wants for instance ryanair and singapore airlines are both in the business of flying customers from point a to b but the outcomes their customers desire are very different what ryanair s customers want is a low fare while customers of singapore airlines with its premium service model desire something very different both airlines are successfully transporting their customers but delivering a different cx to their customers the lesson different cxs are required for different customer segments customers want to acquire products and services as efficiently as possible this is why amazon has built vast warehouses across the u s and why it is now seeking to make the order to delivery process even more efficient by using delivery drones and taking orders via its ai assistant echo in our retail business we know that customers want low prices and i know that s going to be true years from now they want fast delivery they want vast selection says ceo jeff bezos 5this truth also explains why many retailers are struggling to get bricks and clicks right the bricks part of the experience continues to be far too inefficient many consumers now order items online and pick them up in a store yet as a tcs survey revealed they are often left disappointed by long lines and ill informed store personnel customers will only do business with bricks companies that offer a unique value laden cx if physical stores are to remain viable in the digital era two conditions must be met the cx they offer must be one that can t be done as well or at all online and it must provide compelling value to customers if either condition is unmet customers will skip bricks and gravitate to companies that deliver the best online cx additionally the bricks must be part of an overall customer value proposition one in which there is synergy between the bricks and the clicks apple excels in this model this truth has many retail banks worried they know that the experience of their physical branches is not compelling enough to stop online only banks from siphoning off customers but there are lessons from other industries that can be instructive apple for example built a

competition within your specific industry and ensure your management is aligned if cx is not a competitive differentiator for your company following the best practices within your industry may suffice but if cx is critical to your company success you must ensure that your whole management team is united in the quest to deliver it if the ceo says cx is a strategic priority but the head of customer service only cares about maximizing the number of calls the contact center s reps can handle per day your company will not be able to deliver on its cx promises one of the biggest cx obstacles we see in established companies is a lack of alignment among management layers digital firms like amazon and upstarts like uber often have an advantage here their management has always focused on cx and

14,today s most over used corporate cliché is disruption see if the following sounds familiar to you from any number of business and technology publications you ve likely read recently the world is changing and we need to change with it as a key part of our strategy we are going to disrupt the enter your favorite industry name here market … but when it comes to customer experience cx the most effective path to major improvements is not necessarily accomplished through seismic shifts or dramatic innovations the next alexa or uber instead companies can often make major gains by creating a culture of continual improvement a constant tweaking of systems and processes these tweaks happen when they continually identify prioritize and address distinct pain points along the customer journey and lifecycle this article will describe how to implement an incremental and iterative approach to cx design and execution we will demonstrate how numerous small improvements can roll up to create significant value and yield impressive roi going for brokein recent years many companies have invested enormous amounts of money in cx initiatives for example the ceo of cruise line operator carnival corp said that his firm has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technology that promises to transform the experience of its passengers walt disney world poured an estimated billion into a cx initiative in the hope that rfid enabled wristbands would change the way visitors do everything from entering their hotel rooms to riding the space mountain discount retailer target corp announced it would spend billion on a multiyear plan to revamp both the digital and in store shopping experience to adapt to rapidly evolving guest preferences 3these massive cx investments have prompted other companies to follow suit globally cx spending is expected to reach billion in nearly three times the amount spent in in five years cx spending could double again to billion as cx becomes the most important priority of many companies 4clearly executives recognize the importance of cx to their businesses present and future viability companies invest in cx and prioritize cx improvements because they ve seen evidence that cx matters research firm forrester has shown that cx leaders had six times greater revenue growth than cx laggards from to and between and companies that excelled at cx achieved nearly four times the total stock market returns of competitors with poor cx 6why small changes can go farthere s no doubt that large investments to improve the customer experience can yield positive roi but does one need to throw billions or even hundreds of million of dollars at cx to move the needle not necessarily we believe companies can achieve major improvements in cx from targeted investments in just a few customer touch points for instance by some estimates amazon has generated billions of dollars in revenue simply by taking the friction out of online shopping via its patented click ordering process zappos by putting a free return label on its deliveries and implementing a day return policy won the loyalty of high end shoe shoppers looking for an easier and less risky way to splurge on fancy footwear in fact the company has said that customers who sent back half their purchases buy more of its products nordstrom has begun putting kiosks outside store entrances so that online shoppers can pick up items without having to find a parking spot in mall lots and garages a low tech facilitator for the high tech omni channel cx nordstrom considers this critical as of its total sales now come through the online channel 8finding small cx improvements with big returnswe use a two step mapping process to help companies identify lower cost cx opportunities with outsized roi map the customer s journey in detail what it is today vs what it needs to be tomorrow when customers contemplate a purchase they embark on a journey they evaluate their needs explore which companies can solve those needs make a purchase decision take possession of the product and begin using it any customer journey can be segmented into dozens or even hundreds of micro steps the challenge is to step into the shoes of customers and walk the journey mapping out the details across the customer lifecycle awareness research selection purchase usage and maintenance that hopefully lead to repeat purchases once you map out such a journey in as much detail as possible the next step is to look for ways to improve each step the customer takes what improvements can make the journey easier faster or more pleasant without causing major organizational disruption for the company for example minor improvements in the usability of a smartphone app could improve cx in ways that yield significant roi according to research from forrester and the national retail federation nrf smartphones are driving retail sales more than ever retailers have found that even modest investments in mobile initiatives can result in huge returns says artemis barry vp of digital retail at nrf 9figure the tcs customer enterprise framework2 map your own capabilities what they are today vs what they need to be tomorrow having mapped your customer s current journey and pinpointed changes that could yield significant improvements your next step is to match those changes to your organization s capabilities a customer enterprise framework as shown in figure can be a valuable tool to determine which skills business processes systems and technology infrastructure need improvements consider for example the case of a large internet cable phone company that had to improve the customer experience provided by its contact centers its average care times were much longer than the industry average leading to customer frustration and significantly increased operating costs further investigation identified the root of the problem outdated technology coupled with inefficient processes customers were handed off from one representative to another while the reps themselves struggled to cope with more than a dozen disparate it systems by adding a bit more automation to the front end process feeding web leads into a crm workflow and improving the it interface allowing the call center reps to see information from multiple systems at once the company decreased handling time these relatively minor and focused improvements had a big impact on cx and they were the tip of the iceberg in the company s cx initiative only an excellent cx can retain fickle customersthe cx stakes have never been higher than they are today the ease of digital interactions and rising expectations for instant attention and service have made customers increasingly willing to shift their spending to a competitor even after just one negative experience indeed in forrester found of consumers have a high willingness and ability to shift their spending to another company and another of consumers building that mindset 10in this environment companies must continuously look to improve the end to end customer experience not tomorrow with massive initiatives that may take years to implement but right now but companies trying to implement a culture of continuous cx improvement should also expect internal pushback the biggest barriers to achieving better cx are often cultural rather than technological the cable operator s contact center had long been synonymous with personalized high touch service although research showed that customers now prefer faster more efficient and automated interactions the head of the customer care center worried that efficiency and automation would cost some of his employees their jobs he did not recognize that in an era where cable companies must compete with a growing array of new competitors like netflix and hulu the bigger risk was that dissatisfied customers would simply take their business elsewhere potentially endangering the jobs of all the cable company s employees cultural pushback can masquerade as financial prudence i e we d love to improve cx but we just don t havethe money now such objections do not hold water there are ways to make cx better within any budget if money is tight the best thing is to start small but make sure that those narrow changes will have the biggest possible impact in this way you can demonstrate the value of

15,how has the retail industry s idea of superior customer service changed recently the retail industry is in the midst of a tectonic change and the lines between the digital and physical shopper experience are blurring possessing powerful technologies at their fingertips customers expect retailers to meet their needs and wants at will leading to anytime anywhere commerce additionally customers want a frictionless shopping experience this is forcing retailers to make major changes in the customer experience the story of katie a busy mom illustrates this well while katie s shopping journey is ideal and simple the grocery store s responsibility to deliver such frictionless and superior customer service is not at all easy in this example customer service is about delivering a seamless experience the right items present at the right store and the right recommendations being made and offered at the right price additionally parts of the retail supply chain the inventory availability time of pickup and the last mile fulfillment are now more visible to the consumer and not hidden behind the scenes what is more store personnel play a more important role to ensure the last mile of the consumer s process is hassle free all in all the customer experience is becoming personalized transparent seamless and real time what emerging technologies are most important to giving retailers a fuller faster picture of customer likes and dislikes we first need to explain what fuller and faster means for consumers fuller means a seamless shopping experience irrespective of what channels customers use but it also means knowing customers likes and dislikes throughout their shopping journey faster means instant gratification that could mean filling an online order the same day or even within a couple of hours with technologies such as internet of things sensors and mobile devices shopping becomes simpler for consumers but more complicated for retailers more consumers are using smartphones or iot connected devices to place orders from their homes and have merchants later deliver them to achieve this retailers face huge complexities their supply chain network has to choose the closest source for each item while keeping customer preferences in mind retailers must also make sure they deliver according to customer expectations and replenish inventory for the next customer with the advent of smart robotics retailers can now program human like intelligence and learning capabilities into mobile robots delivery drones and other machines that can free up store associates to spend more time on the floor serving customers and less time in the back room big data cloud ai and social media tools also help retailers deliver truly exceptional customer experiences looking ahead internet of things smart machines intelligent automation and real time data technologies will be crucial for retailers trying to transform this fuller and faster vision into a reality what is the next frontier for retailers in delighting customers it boils down to this extreme personalization at every interaction point having a degree view of the customer and using it across the retail value chain will be a key differentiator for retailers personalization could mean getting the assortments pricing decisions product recommendations and customized loyalty programs right for every single customer it could even include designing the customer experience and offering appropriate solutions based on the customer s current context delivering extreme one on one personalization will be the next frontier in delighting and delivering truly exceptional customer experience and service retailers that can deliver extreme personalization at every point of the customer journey will be the true winners in this digital age doing so will also require retailers to involve customers in the design of products and the in store experience design thinking will play a key role here how important will personalization be to retailers personalization will be crucial a century ago when mom and pop stores dominated the store owner knew your name and preferences he often knew even your anniversary or birthdays it was an extremely personal relationship with the rise of mass merchants warehouse clubs and huge supermarket chains in the last years personalization moved to the store level but not the individual consumer level somewhere in the shift to large format retailing we lost the personal touch of the old mom and pop store now we are getting it back with big data and advanced analytics technologies it is possible to establish the same kind of one to one personalization a leading u s retailer developed what it believes is one of the world s largest customer intelligence systems the platform gives it a degree view of customers this retailer is beginning to use the insights from that system to personalize every point of interaction with their customers,retail understanding your customer performance faster
16,companies around the world have spent a ton of money on customer relationship management crm systems more than billion annually yet many are still awaiting a financial return from their investments this is especially true in b2b companies many of which have told us that a sales force with more data is not necessarily a sales force that generates more revenue closes more deals and wins more repeat business however we also know of b2b firms that have generated robust returns from their crm investments in these companies salespeople and sales managers can t ever imagine life without a crm system so what are b2b companies that are struggling to get value from crm doing wrong from our experience their sales functions continue to live by seven principles each of which has become a myth i ll go through each one and explain why they have become problematic then i ll discuss the new beliefs that should replace the myths myth no we have a long time to sellthis now obsolete notion is that the b2b sales cycle is long and thus a sales person has weeks or months to close a deal after an inquiry comes in while research suggests the b2b purchasing process remains long the sales process has shortened the average b2b buyer is nearly of the way through his buying process before he talks to a single vendor according to ceb you have less time to make a positive impression than you did before because by the time a buyer is ready to look at vendors he has done most of his homework it s a reason why of b2b buyers rated timeliness of a vendor s response to their inquiries as a key reason for choosing the winning vendor 3this means your sales force must know precisely what matters to your customers decision makers and tailor the information to their needs b2b buyers today say the most influential part of suppliers websites is relevant content that speaks directly to their company if you haven t created a wellspring of such educational content in advance you re at a distinct disadvantage to the competitor that has it but it s not just about content it s also about serving that content in the channels your customer uses to engage with your organization website secure portals contact centers even social media your sales and service representatives not only need this content they need relevant data on the customer from which they can draw insights and increasingly your people need artificial intelligence to recommend the next steps they should take with customers your website too should make those recommendations to customers based on how they interact with your site myth no most times best price wins the businessthis myth is especially prevalent in commodity businesses to be sure in many b2b sectors being price competitive is still important but other factors come into play including tailoring commodity offerings to customers unique needs and providing trustworthy advice on how to get more value from them the latest research by salesforce com found that nearly four out of five b2b buyers greatly value salespeople who can be trusted advisers it s because the stakes in many b2b purchases a large investment a career and competitive advantage are rising salespeople who help buyers think through their needs and reduce those risks stand out an average of people are involved in b2b purchases according to ceb the biggest challenge for companies making a purchasing decision is getting their decision makers to agree on the problem and the right way to solve it both of which happen before they choose a supplier the most successful b2b suppliers help decision makers reframe their problem and approach to solving it but becoming such a trusted adviser isn t easy it requires a supplier to liberally share customer information and insights internally what division division division and so on know about the same customer in many companies phenomenal amounts of information on any single customer exist in divisions product units geographies and functions but few can easily bring this information together because their systems don t share data and aren t connected myth no a strong brand overcomes ineffective sales processeswrong again i m not saying that a strong b2b brand is of little value it can get you in the door and on the shortlist but if you don t react to new sales opportunities well enough and fast enough your company s familiar logo won t help much companies like linkedin and paychex prove that b2b companies can come out of nowhere and gain share with a superior offering and competent sales processes but little advertising highly competent sales forces are critical to success mckinsey has found that firms with strong capabilities in qualifying and pursuing leads presales work have win rates of to of new deals and to with repeat business using modern sales practices and enabling technologies sales forces can anticipate and eventually predict customer needs myth no b2b customers don t buy on emotion thus they don t need a compelling sales experience this is no longer true if it ever was while b2b buyers expect vendors to provide good educational information online long before they sign a purchase order it takes only one piece of bad information about a vendor to sour a relationship there s a lot riding today for b2b companies on multimillion dollar purchases emotion plays a bigger role in the decision a survey by google and ceb of buyers of products and services from b2b brands found b2b customers were significantly more emotionally connected to their vendors than consumers were to the brands they purchased it s up to sales people to deal with the emotional component of the customer s purchase decision giving sales and service representatives insights into customer motivations allows them to tailor their interactions to those motivations it is also important to not forget the basics of great sales training and management in the end selling remains a people business sales representatives who can tailor your message and help buyers understand how your solution solves their problem are fundamentals that must not be lost in this age of technology myth no current customers will give you more slack in how fast you respondmany loyal customers aren t as patient as they used to be and for good reasons regulatory political and competitive customers are often working against fixed time frames targets or business objectives against which they will be measured we know of telecommunications equipment manufacturers that must respond to leads from telcos much faster than in the past the reason is telco purchasing cycles have accelerated due to exploding demands for digital data that courses through their networks taking six months to configure the equipment increasingly won t satisfy such customers streamlining the quote to cash process in your organization and giving sales and service representatives the right tools allows them to respond faster applied across channels those same tools can even allow customers to serve themselves to your offerings reducing time and resource constraints one telecommunications equipment manufacturer now lets customers configure and submit orders through a web portal or by talking to a contact center representative that s shaved weeks off the old sales process the results in increased sales have been phenomenal myth no b2b sales are sequential and should focus on providing customers with informationlots of companies are spending heavily on educational material that explains their products and services and how customers should use them but many b2b buyers still have much to sort out after they ve read such vendor content it is up to sales people to further educate customers sales people with exceptional educational skills remain highly valued forrester predicts million of the worlds million b2b sales jobs will disappear by supplanted by technology out of the four seller archetypes order takers sales people who sell non complex offerings in non complex buying situations would be eliminated by self service online portals however consultants sales people selling complex offerings in complex buying situations would thrive because they can make comprehensible abstract concepts and build relationships 8technology can help a sales force make a consultative sell a global information services company created an online community for entrepreneurs and business owners to make connections with others like them at similar stages of development it also helped them procure the services they needed and used gamification to measure participation and contributions to the communities the net result was that the vendor s brand shifted from merely being an information provider to one that assembled a community of experts myth no b2b customers don t want a multichannel selling experiencenot true anymore they not only need extremely knowledgeable sales people they need highly informative websites webinars seminars mobile apps and other channels that help them make better decisions with so many channels for a b2b sales force to use now how can it create a sales experience in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts a good way to start is through a high level customer segmentation via personas lay out the customer journeys for a maximum of five personas e g repeat vs new customers infrequent vs frequent purchasers etc then identify what information your firm possesses that would improve how sales people interact with each persona in each step of their buying journey and in each sales channel but don t fall into the trap of only focusing on the customer journey and not on the supporting processes if a customer places an order you still need to fill it you must link your customer facing efforts to your back end processes and systems if you don t you ll create an initial positive sentiment on the front end but obliterate it when your firm doesn t fill orders correctly or on time on the back end or if you provide poor service many b2b sales forces continue to live by one or more of these seven myths those that have replaced them

17,digital technology lets companies tailor their interactions to customers specific needs and wants companies with such personalization capabilities can create a formidable competitive advantage consequently personalizing the customer experience has become a new battlefield for companies forrester called it one of the critical success factors for winning in the age of the customer noting that customers will reward companies that anticipate their individual need and punish those that do not accordingly leading companies are adopting new technological capabilities and processes to customize the customer experience across various channels throughout the customer lifecycle digital leaders like amazon have effective recommendation engines that not only increase their share of the customer s customers but also make their lives easier netflix sends its internet television subscribers personalized suggestions based on their viewing habits and has decreased customer churn by several percentage points the netflix personalization strategy has increased the lifetime value of an existing netflix subscriber while reducing the number of new customers the company must acquire to achieve its revenue targets personalization is worth more than billion a year for netflix 2the question of personalization as a competitive imperative is no longer in question the new question is how to meet the customer s expectations for intimacy while still respecting privacy norms and boundaries in other words companies must figure out how to tune into customers without turning them off customers will reward companies that anticipate their individual need and punish those that do not according to a survey of adults around the world more than half of consumers expect the brands they do business with to understand their needs and preferences however there are boundaries that firms need to monitor and understand • roughly three quarters of consumers said companies that used their personal data without their permission were violating their privacy • nearly three quarters of consumers say online ads that use information gleaned from their online behaviors and activities make them uneasy with half of them saying such experiences make them feel creeped out according to a ceb gartner survey 4• yet only of corporate marketing professionals that ceb gartner surveyed felt their personalized marketing communications offended customers that is a significant disconnect that all companies should address generally customers are more willing to share personal data that enables personalization if they trust the company requesting it to keep their information secure and if they feel that the company is giving them something they value in return for their information but why does one company s attempt to provide that value keep customers coming back for more while another s attempt winds up creeping customers out and driving them away many companies struggle to answer that question generally customers are more willing to share personal data that enables personalization if they trust the company requesting it to keep their information secure and if they feel that the company is giving them something they value in return for their information but why does one company s attempt to provide that value keep customers coming back for more while another s attempt winds up creeping customers out and driving them away many companies struggle to answer that question the seven deadly sins of personalizationbased on our experience across numerous industries and clients tcs has identified seven common personalization mistakes that companies make while interacting with their customers in one on one situations figure below showcases the seven deadly personalization sins figure seven deadly personalization sins1 breaking bonds sharing or selling personal information without the customer s clear understanding for example by requiring customers to opt in to have their data collected or shared just a handful of industries in the u s such as healthcare have regulations regarding how customer information must be handled most companies are not required to notify customers about the ways in which they may use their personal data in fact the u s congress recently repealed online privacy protections that would have prevented internet providers from selling customer data including their web browsing histories without permission but just because companies can dig into and distribute their customers personal data without their knowledge does not mean they should digging too deep correlating personal or behavioral data for example email or cross website browsing data outside of the direct interactions between the company and its customers for personalized purposes can make customers feel spied upon this often happens when someone searches for information on a website say looking for a car and is then served car ads when visiting a clothing site helicoptering companies increasingly offer real time personalization based on the customer s location and prior purchases but this can come back to haunt that company imagine the luxury store dressing room attendant who knows your name as you approach her would you feel comfortable about trying on clothes in the back room and leaving them all behind if they were too tight this time we doubt it overcrowding high volumes of personalized marketing from multiple groups within a company can make customers feel bombarded and even harassed for example a customer buys a toaster and suddenly his inbox is full of kitchen appliance and kitchen renovation pitches category jumping conjoining multiple topics with minimal linkages annoys customers a car dealer s following up on a customer s purchase of car mats with an offer for a bike rack because of the customer s recent purchase of a bicycle is creepy for the customer he wonders how the car dealer made that logical leap another example of category jumping is the customer who purchases diet soda and then begins receiving advertisements for weight loss products boudoir topics exploiting potentially sensitive situations e g purchase of pregnancy tests to deliver personalized discounts e g baby products may alienate customers some offers are best left to multi product efforts that target personal needs with a broader basket of goods the customer is influenced by such marketing while not feeling specifically targeted moral hazards these are the practices that cover a range of tactics that are technically legal but would reflect poorly on the company if exposed what would your mother think is a question marketers should ask themselves if you think mom would disapprove eschew these practices handling customization with careunderstanding and respecting the boundaries of acceptable customer experience personalization is a critical first step each company must create its own approach one that lays out the values strategy execution methods and governance it needs to be effective without being creepy figure below captures the factors governing personalization valuesbefore making any technology investment or strategy decision an organization must decide where it sits on the customer personalization spectrum an organization s culture and the nature of its customer relationships should guide its personalization values more conservative firms or those that depend upon high levels of customer trust such as financial services and healthcare may take a more restrained approach to mining customer data for personalization retailers or social media companies on the other hand may better be able to push the envelope without encountering customer resistance this is the stage where an enterprise should decide what might be a boudoir topic for its customers or what those customers might consider a betrayal of trust companies seeking to capitalize on personalization must clearly define the limits of their marketing practices and communicate them broadly throughout the organization figure governing personalizationstrategythe next step in outlining the desired business outcomes of personalization is defining the strategies is the purpose of its customer interactions to provide better post sale customer service increase conversion rates or reduce marketing costs through effective targeting companies must also decide which channels will benefit from personalization efforts and which channels will not companies that benefit from personalization based on potentially sensitive customer data may limit that personalization to more private channels like email vs sms messages in a retail environment companies must base their personalization strategies on their values they must broadly share their values and enforce them in all business units and customer facing functions the largest hurdle is translating those values into tactical directions so that marketing sales and customer service groups avoid issues such as helicoptering or overcrowding to ensure that everyone plays by the rules the strategy must coordinate actions across functions and business units executionin executing their personalization strategies companies must make oversight and govern top priorities a big challenge for them is balancing the need to remain true to their customer values while letting marketing experiment with the latest digital marketing technologies and personalization approaches this requires experimentation guidelines that balance the need to improve marketing

18,the relentless spread of mobile apps now offers companies an unimagined degree of access and connection to their customers but the flood of companies looking to seize this opportunity has given rise to a new challenge in this intensely competitive space how can you ensure that potential and existing customers will download and use your company s apps this is among other things a design challenge with serious business consequences as the power of mobile apps to create competitive differentiation and advantage grows across industries and geographies fielding compelling apps is becoming ever more important to win market share in the mobile world companies must develop and deliver apps whose quality usability and functionality make them irresistible to demanding customers more is riding on useful apps mobile is the future predicted google s then ceo eric schmidt in schmidt s prediction came true fast in of americans owned a smartphone more than double the percentage in 1the use of mobile apps followed in lockstep with the explosion in mobile device ownership an estimated billion mobile apps were downloaded in that same year the average american spent nearly hours a month using mobile apps and one in seven of their app sessions lasted longer than minutes 3the rising use of apps means they increasingly define how consumers and businesses buy products and services access information troubleshoot their purchases play games and consume entertainment and interact with others this has resulted in a windfall for companies that excel at app development mobile is the future witness starbucks as of q1 customers had downloaded starbucks mobile order and pay app million times in that quarter alone orders placed through the app generated an estimated of the coffee house chain s u s store transactions no wonder then ceo now executive chairman howard schultz proclaimed technology innovation is further strengthening our brand improving our efficiency and in store execution increasing our profitability and most importantly enabling us to deliver an elevated starbucks experience to our customers unfortunately when it comes to mobile apps companies like starbucks are an exception many companies are not getting full value from their apps a recent study revealed that of users fail to return to newly downloaded apps the next day while average app retention rates fall to just after days 5howard schultz proclaimed technology innovation is further strengthening our brand improving our efficiency and in store execution increasing our profitability and most importantly enabling us to deliver an elevated starbucks experience to our customers the deficiencies of many apps are also evident in sales conversion rates on e commerce sites in adobe reported that only of shopping carts on smartphone apps converted to orders compared with for shopping carts on desktop computers simply having an app doesn t cut it concluded the report s authors the app graveyard is getting larger due to abandonment and lack of mobile optimization 6there are three primary reasons why apps end up in the graveyard a disappointing experience many apps simply do not provide a great or even a good customer experience a arc research study of u s travel apps found that four of the largest airlines were rated among the bottom eight apps in the industry because of quality shortcomings 7a flawed business case other apps are launched in the wrong place at the wrong time london based hailo launched its yellow cab ride hailing app in new york city just as uber was achieving scale in that market the uber juggernaut sank the new service an overly complex design still other apps are too ambitious coming to market hobbled by a crippling load of complexity the mobile app challenge is further exacerbated because customer expectations are continually raising the design bar particularly relating to the user experience these mobile moments are the next battleground where companies will win serve and retain their customers explains forrester research vice president judy ask tragically few companies will make the leap those that do will reap the rewards 9three design precepts for upping your app gameyour company can reap the rewards of mobile apps if you keep three design precepts in mind understand that companies like starbucks uber and facebook are determining your customers expectations for the mobile app experience even if you re selling process control equipment to oil refineries while the technological capabilities that power your apps should become even more sophisticated they must always deliver an even simpler more seamless user experience your apps must be able to learn your customers preferences and behaviors and use that knowledge to personalize their experience via a continuous and virtuous feedback loop customer expectations start with the best b2c appsusers expect all apps to perform as well as those created by the leading consumer app developers that means your app will not be measured against your direct competitors apps but against the experience provided by companies like snapchat instagram and youtube use emerging technologies to simplify the customer experience while increasing functionalitycompanies can use a variety of new emerging technologies to create apps that learn from their users and automatically adjust to their needs for instance when a customer only uses a banking app for transferring money between accounts an app can streamline and simplify the user experience by taking the customer directly to that function while hiding or minimizing others voice technology is rapidly rising on the list of customer app expectations because of offerings like apple s siri amazon s echo and google voice voice integration and recognition is beginning to simplify the ordering process thereby removing the friction that causes consumers to abandon shopping carts at checkout bots driven by ai promise to become central to app mediated customer engagements as bots become more sophisticated they will be able to answer customer questions resolve their problems and complete their orders more efficiently and cost effectively than many customer service employees computer vision which can process analyze and understand digital images producing algorithms to drive decision making is also adding new dimensions to the app experience in a wide variety of applications for example microsoft is collaborating with appliance company liebherr to develop a refrigerator that recognizes the food on its shelves communicates with the owner s smartphone and creates a shopping list in the app based on what the refrigerator sees 10predictive analytics enables apps to anticipate user behaviors and act accordingly in many cases utilizing wireless sensors big data and analytics technologies nest thermostat apps for example sense when you arrive home and change the temperature based on your preferences and then change it again after you leave all these technologies will further elevate the role of smartphones in your customers lives and as your customers do more and more business within the mobile universe your company s apps will need to be as smart as their phones which leads to our final design precept design apps that learn users preferences and behaviors and continually personalize the experience in apple rejected a blackberry like keyboard with physical buttons in favor of a software based keyboard as a result apple has been able to improve its keyboard s functionality iteratively continually delivering new functionalities remotely to its customers the lesson for app designers don t hard code the user experience into your app companies encounter this lesson in one of the first decisions they face when designing an app should it be native to a single operating system os or a hybrid that works across systems and devices app designers quickly learned that each mobile operating system comes with its own capabilities and limitations and responded with a hybrid approach that enabled the development of apps for many devices and operating systems this ability led some companies to make the native or hybrid decision too quickly and with too little thought often these companies simply followed the lead of other companies that had developed similar apps but the correct answer for your company depends on the specific requirements of your app going the native route can add significant cost and time to app development it also increases the total cost of ownership as maintaining several native apps for different operating systems is more expensive than maintaining a single hybrid app however for complex apps that require tapping the unique capabilities of a specific os a native app may be the right approach hybrid apps can be developed faster than native apps and thus at lower cost but different operating systems have inherently different styles for swiping scrolling etc as a result an app designed to work on all of them inevitably will not perform as well as one designed to work with one these variances in performance frustrate users moreover hybrid apps typically cannot take full advantage of each os s unique capabilities apps are where it s atwith more business transacted via smartphones in both the b2c and b2b arenas all companies need to think about how they can use mobile apps to serve their customers better as well as enhance their apps performance and results it takes time and investment to acquire the capabilities they will need to design apps that offer compelling experiences however as mobile apps become an increasingly important competitive and brand differentiator companies that rise to the

19,the next battle in the customer experience wars will not be the fight to win sales but the struggle to dominate the after sale the key weapon in that war will be systems built around internet of things iot sensors and wireless communications that will enable companies to track their products services and in many cases their customers after the purchase has been completed the goal is to continue adding value to a company s product or service thereby winning the customer s loyalty and setting the scene for future revenue streams throughout the customer lifecycle iot technologies are advancing rapidly global iot spending will grow at a compound rate of through when it will become a trillion market according to a idc report iot technologies are graduating from the experimentation phase and becoming central to business strategy it is no longer a question of whether and when the technology will deliver value but where they will have the greatest impact the post sales experience ripe for reinvention will be one of those areas for many products the post sale experience is the biggest driver of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction four out of american consumers said their post sale experience with a company was the most memorable aspect of the brand experience and eight out of said a positive post purchase experience was important 2for many products the post sale experience is the biggest driver of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction in addition to post sales brand impact new technologies will have a major impact on the costs of taking care of customers throughout the product lifecycle clearly the opportunity is enormous for companies across industries to embrace iot systems to transform the post sales experience the iot can provide companies with the ultimate truth on product performance how their offerings are performing in the hands of customers 3companies that leverage iot technologies to reveal those truths most effectively will win the customer experience wars transforming the post purchase worldiot systems present companies with a wide range of opportunities to improve or even reinvent the post sale experience for themselves and their customers from increasing customer satisfaction to reducing costs to shortening response times we have identified five key areas where iot technologies can help transform this experience getting ahead of pending product failures and service problemsone of the most obvious ways that iot can improve the post sale experience is using the technology to better understand how products are performing in the field in doing so companies can avoid frustrating value destroying equipment failures and costly service visits before they happen this is especially important in high tech and other industries where high value assets are deployed automated teller machine atm maker diebold nixdorf inc has been using technology to diagnose and remotely repair its atms without having to dispatch a technician this is a complete strategic transformation for the company whose service processes were built around dispatching parts and labor whenever there was a problem with a machine diebold nixdorf can now solve of atm problems remotely which has reduced atm downtime by and whittled the turnaround time to fix an atm from three hours to less than minutes 4coca cola enterprise in europe has been using sensors on its vending machines to track supplies and machine problems for several years and ge healthcare is internet connecting two million medical imaging machines worldwide including of its own 6with iot companies from telecom equipment manufacturers to hardware vendors can monitor their devices for signs of impending problems thereby reducing the number of customer repair visits improving first time fix metrics and generally shortening the time to repair proactive maintenance enabled by the iot is applicable in consumer electronics and other home goods from hot water tanks to hdtvs improving the customer experience and keeping companies in front of their customers after the sale as the cost of iot enabled devices comes down the scope will continue to increase reducing the number and costs of returnsreverse logistics are a major cost in retailing and other sectors according to the national retail federation of consumer products sold by retailers in the u s are returned annually accounting for billion in merchandise and while it may be relatively simple to return a product on the front end the process is extremely complex and expensive on the back end iot technology capable of diagnosing or preventing product issues could reduce the likelihood of product returns and the associated costs of returns handling customers might be less likely to return items if they are fixed quickly and remotely benefiting the customer who retrieves greater value from his or her purchase and preserving retailer revenues while reducing post sale return costs remotely diagnosing problematic products that are beyond the point of repair will save companies from paying to have them returned customers instead can be asked to dispose of the products themselves increasing value and convenience throughout the product lifecyclethere are many ways companies can use iot technologies to help customers make better use of their products post purchase as well as experience less frustration with them ge aviation s predix software platform enables its customers to get better performance and greater value from the jet engines it sells them hp has turned its products into iot hubs in its customers homes it fitted its printers with wireless sensors to monitor ink levels and trigger replacement cartridge orders before the customer runs out providing both convenience and recurring revenue amazon has introduced an iot button based on its consumer dash button for reordering products which developers and programmers can use to access amazon s cloud to count or track items order services from tv programs to pizza or provide feedback one company has even introduced internet connected prescription bottles that sense how many capsules are left inside how often an individual is taking the pills and how changes in prescription regimen affect test results 10according to the national retail federation of consumer products sold by retailers in the u s are returned annually accounting for billion in merchandise informing r diot sensors can be a valuable source of data to inform the development of new or improved products and services by analyzing the ways in which customers use their products and services companies can determine which features are most useful and which customers consider less valuable common sources of failure can be addressed in future designs and the data retrieved from products can significantly shorten the design test build development cycle helping companies bring new products and services to market more quickly thereby gaining a march on their competitors increasing sales opportunitiesdata gathered from iot connected devices enable companies to evolve from reactive to proactive selling and not just of post purchase services such as ink cartridges companies can analyze the ongoing performance of the products they sell to customers for trends that might indicate other product needs a network equipment manufacturer might notice customer usage patterns that are straining the customer s existing infrastructure and use that data to sell the company more appropriate networking products to prevent future failures applying iot to the post sales experiencewhile there is clear value in implementing iot infrastructure to improve the customer s long term product or service experience many companies struggle with deciding where to start there are five steps a company can take to identify and begin pursuing these opportunities determine the best use casesbefore thinking about investment companies should seek to understand which products or services would benefit most from iot enablement expensive goods and services or those with a greater incidence of service issues are good targets internet connecting a product that consumers are likely to throw away if it fails is wasted investment in fact tcs research found that of companies were using sensors to monitor products valued at million to million while just were doing so with products valued at or less calculate the impactcreating robust business cases can be time consuming and difficult since iot is still an emerging area but companies can use existing data to create proxy business cases to get a good idea of the financial impact of iot on their product or service prior to making a large investment conduct a mini proof of conceptbegin by internet connecting one product or product line to make sure the technology works and is generating the benefits expected for the company and its customers the outcome of this will help inform future business cases and validate the assumptions you make piggy backing on a new product release can be a good place to start rather than reverse engineering an existing product make the case for customer data sharingit s important to make it clear what customers can expect in exchange for sharing data with the company hp offered customers savings of up to for participating in its initial iot enabled

20,it costs billion per year to field the billion calls made annually to the world s customer contact centers many of these are already highly automated using voice recognition and other technologies to expedite call routing and processing but advances in digital technologies could help these centers deliver far better service to more customers at lower cost here is a look at ways in which companies can evolve their contact centers and increase customer loyalty and profitability from call centers to contact centersonce upon a time most people contacted customer service by telephone just years ago smartphones were in their infancy social media was for kids and it was rare for anyone to use email to contact a company to ask a question or file a complaint that world is vanishing in digital contact email web chat social media and self service channels was on pace to overtake voice based contact by this year but these new capabilities don t come cheaply for many corporations contact centers are a major expense and while they have more potential than ever to maintain and increase customer loyalty they also have become large and growing cost centers we believe that the best approach to modernizing a contact center is to do it in phases automation customer engagement and transformation let s look at each stage three stages for upgrading the contact centerwhich stage to begin requires asking a few critical questions three are elemental how important is customer service to your company is it a non critical component or a competitive differentiator how complex is your product or service a simple product may not need a lot of customer support while a more complex product or service might demand plenty of high touch handholding do your customers depend on the continuous operation of your products or services for their own success or are they willing to tolerate occasional interruptions and downtime for example a homeowner might be disappointed if a backyard barbecue grill fails to light in july but be desperate if a home furnace malfunctions in january once you answer those questions you can go deeper into your three options for the contact center as shown in figure figure three stages for evolving the contact center1 automation for efficiency and lower costsif you choose the automation approach your goal should be to reduce customer volume in high cost engagement channels such as phone calls by shifting as much volume as possible to low cost automated channels such as internet based self service knowledge banks and chat bots if your contact center is not automated a first step would be to introduce basic automation elements such as interactive voice response ivr systems that allow callers to obtain answers to many common questions in a self service system on the back end process automation can improve agent productivity by reducing the time it takes to solve common simple problems meanwhile descriptive analytics can pinpoint service problems to remove bottlenecks one of the uk s leading media and telecom businesses reduced costs million a year merely by cutting down on handling times resolving customer problems the first time and reducing call transfers consolidation goes together with automation if you have multiple data centers you can reduce your real estate costs by merging them into fewer larger facilities at the same time systems consolidation combined with on demand cloud resources can reduce hardware costs of course if your contact center is not a competitive driver for your business you might want to consider the financial and operational implications of outsourcing the function such automation initiatives should be judged according to the metrics such as lower operational costs coupled with greater efficiency e g higher call volume per agent shorter average time to resolution etc consider the case of cell c the third largest gsm telecom service provider in south africa the company implemented a next generation contact center solution using the oracle service cloud the new system centralized and streamlined the way cell c provided customer service enabling cross channel reporting and establishing a robust knowledge management system by automating key business processes including prioritization and distribution of incoming customer inquiries cell c provided customers with a better experience improved agent productivity and reduced operating costs eventually cell c expects more customers will turn to the self service knowledge base which should limit growth in call center volume and keep costs contained customer engagement happier agents more loyal customersfor many companies the contact center has become a competitive necessity if not an advantage in a global survey of contact center executives viewed customer experience as a means to differentiate their company half said they felt that contact centers play a primary role in customer retention a recent harvard business review article argued that the better the environment for contact center agents the better the outcomes for customers we agree customer satisfaction starts with satisfied contact center agents to boost agent satisfaction we suggestreinvesting the cost savings achieved through automation to streamline the systems that agents use making their work easier provide them with new skills adding valuable learning to the work environment the goal should be to cultivate a culture of customer engagement across traditional and newer channels by training agents to use new digital channels e g chat social media text messages etc to solve customer problems and identify customer needs if you follow a customer engagement strategy track success by customer churn rates and satisfaction scores first contact resolution percentages abandon rates the percentage of customers who hang up before agents can help them and customer lifetime value one way to measure whether agents are satisfied is by tracking turnover for example a large automaker had an outdated contact center that could only handle voice calls the automaker deployed new technology that enabled agents to provide multichannel support across email phone sms and chat a knowledge management solution gave agents access to internal and external information sources thanks to these optimizations and upgrades the company achieved faster complaint resolution and higher customer satisfaction scores the new system also enabled managers to easily create reports that provided valuable customer insights transformation predicting and preventing customer problemsare the products your company sells or the services it provides vital to your customers operations that s often the case for industrial companies selling high ticket items like aircraft engines to business customers if this is your business you might consider transforming your contact center into a profit center by embedding internet of things iot technology into your company s products you can gain access to a trove of data with proper analysis this data will give you a better understanding of the way that customers use your products and services iot technology can also enable prescriptive analytics allowing your contact center to move beyond responding to customer problems and to begin anticipating them with remote diagnostics tools agents can monitor equipment and reach out to customers to flag concerns suggest improvement opportunities or stop problems before they occur instead of focusing first on your own business efficiency a transformative contact center approach looks to make your customers operations more efficient turning them into loyal brand advocates as a transformative contact center initiative begins to succeed you should see lower customer acquisition costs and higher transaction conversion rates average order values should increase ultimately the primary measure of success will be whether the contact center drives revenue growth and profit it takes skilled agents to transform a contact center they will need high level customer management and analytical skills along with a passion for solving problems for example contact center agents at a cable and phone service provider that monitors customer data usage for abnormal activity could reach out to alert customers if they might be experiencing a hacking attack in another sector we ve been working with a utility provider to prove the feasibility of having the contact center plugged into data from a connected home if sensors indicate that a furnace has failed or a hot water heater has sprung a leak the agent could call to help the customer avoid a catastrophe creating contact centers for a complex worlddigital technology now occupies every corner of our lives and as products and services incorporate digital technologies they become more complex customers need more support to use these digitally enhanced products and services to their full potential and now that those products can be interconnected contact centers can be proactive anticipating and preventing customer problems from occurring that will turn such a contact center into a killer app for inspiring loyalty with the right technology and agent training contact centers can help companies stand out deliver memorable service and attract new

22,digital ecosystems increasingly are coalescing around companies that offer consumers the products and services they need to accomplish major goals for example buying a home or car taking a big vacation or finding a new job companies that are knitting these ecosystems together think tripadvisor in travel or truecar com in purchasing autos will begin setting the standard in the digital experience that customers have become accustomed to as such every company that wants to plug into these ecosystems will need to ensure that its piece of the digital experience is on par with those of other companies consider the way consumers buy homes now when many people look for a new home they enter sprawling digital ecosystems filled with connected real estate companies mortgage providers insurance firms home inspectors lawyers movers and more when they search for a new car they find themselves in a digital ecosystem comprising dealers insurers motor vehicle registries and even in car entertainment systems sold by a variety of providers and when they take a vacation they dip into another digital ecosystem of hotels restaurants tour companies entertainment venues and so forth these digital ecosystems first began to emerge approximately years ago starting in travel e g expedia priceline travelocity and automobiles cars com and later in sectors such as music e g itunes launched by apple in a recent gartner survey of more than cios in countries found that of top performers participated in digital ecosystems compared with of average performers and of trailing companies companies at the forefront of digitizing their businesses recognize that they must compete in digital ecosystems which gartner defines as groupings of enterprises competitors customers regulators and other stakeholders that exchange information and interact electronically 2consider a company like tripadvisor which has carved out an important niche in the trillion global travel market the company hosts some million reviews on million hotels motels restaurants and tourist attractions visitors to tripadvisor will find links to more than websites where they can research and book hotels tripadvisor s million unique average monthly visitors have earned the company billion in revenue and million in net income in 3naturally tripadvisor profits from the ecosystem it has built but the company is only successful because its ecosystem partners are also successful the benefit for travelers is convenience and information they can find lodging dining and entertainment options all in one spot and from that one spot they can compare prices reserve rooms make dinner reservations and so on call it the aggregation of their purchase journey the businesses that participate in the ecosystem must compete fiercely for attention primarily by continually improving their offerings and the customer experience cx but access to tripadvisor s vast audience of potential customers makes the competitive pool well worth swimming in companies at the forefront of digitizing their businesses recognize that they must compete in digital ecosystems which gartner defines as groupings of enterprises competitors customers regulators and other stakeholders that exchange information and interact electronically 73delivering better cx through journey aggregationjust as tripadvisor has aggregated the customer s purchase journey for travel so other journey aggregators will soon arise to establish digital ecosystems in just about every industry these aggregators will succeed by simplifying complex purchase pathways offering consumers a more streamlined one stop shopping experience even niche players and startups can grab significant market share and put established competitors on notice by participating in these ecosystems thereby improving the customer journey while offering a better cx the opportunities in the digital universe are too large too numerous and too fleeting for any single company to capture on its own but by assembling diverse coalitions of partners developers collaborators suppliers and others into mutually beneficial digital ecosystems companies can explore new possibilities they could not hope to reach by themselves the question will become this who should assemble these coalitions and should the organizer be a consortium or an independent and impartial organization many companies aren t waiting to find out take kabbage a startup upending the world of small business lending the company recognized that small business owners needed a faster more convenient way to apply

business with the firms in kabbage s digital ecosystem that means more payment processing for paypal more shipping for ups and more accounting business for intuit s quickbooks there s another reason for companies to participate in digital ecosystems if they don t they risk ending up on the outside looking in higher customer expectations higher stakesbecause so much business now is transacted digitally customer expectations for their digital experience have risen customers want instant service and convenience they want a smooth interface and many of them especially those who have grown up

tackle many steps in a larger purchase decision at the same time not just searching real estate listings for a new house step one but simultaneously finding a real estate agent a home inspector a competitive mortgage rate and service providers for any needed repairs or ongoing needs such as telephony security property maintenance and others that is steps two through n all at once via a digital ecosystem how can a company deliver an amazing cx at every step in the customer s purchase journey here are five steps design to differentiate look for the biggest unsolved problems in your customers lives related to the product or service that you provide getting the basics right is a given being a follower is no longer an option to find out what these unsolved problems are you need to ask your customers about them then use design thinking and service design approaches to solve those problems for example one insurance company realized its customers often struggled to provide the documentation necessary to replace items lost in a flood or fire accordingly the company let consumers create a digital vault to store electronic copies of purchase receipts along with photos and other supporting material for their most valuable possessions this digital documentation helps the insurance company make the claims process faster easier and less stressful for the customer gain a deeper understanding of customer needs the best way to satisfy customers is to understand what they want where they want it and when to calibrate offerings to individual customers companies must possess robust data collection and analysis capabilities or like kabbage partner with ecosystem companies that do when amazon realized that customers wanted an even faster and easier way to transact

23,thirty years ago large global companies began building data warehouses centralizing the information they gathered from customers in marketing sales and service interactions about years later these firms began analyzing this data using customer relationship management crm systems their aim to increase revenue by identifying the most profitable highest value customers and to provide them with more targeted care and attention the result would be a better customer experience greater loyalty and higher lifetime customer value over the past years the rise of smartphones and social media has pushed companies to launch customer experience management cxm initiatives to improve and synchronize customers offline and online experiences and optimize touch points where crm reacts to customer initiated sales and service interactions cxm takes a proactive approach for instance by monitoring and sometimes facilitating interactions on social media discussion boards or product review sites as crm and cxm have become must haves many companies are now wondering how they can further differentiate and outdo their competition this is especially important today because those competitors are also leveraging their own crm systems and cxm touch points we believe that the next logical step is for companies to provide value to their customers by using the customer data they re already collected and then helping those customers engage productively with other customers we refer to this as inter customer relationship management or icrm to use an acronym many companies have done this for years but in an ad hoc way for example a mortgage banker might provide a list of local contractors to a customer with a home equity line of credit who is building a home addition or a home improvement store manager might recommend an electrician to a customer interested in upgrading their home s lighting other firms such as large investment banks and enterprise software companies hold annual conferences that let customers network with each other in these events customers form relationships with other customers some of which lead to business but with icrm we propose a deeper more rigorous and more systematic approach to making these customer to customer business transactions happen we believe that companies which offer icrm capabilities will see a big rise in customer loyalty and profitability customers whose businesses thrive thanks to a supplier s icrm program will have the resources and the motivation to do more business with that supplier taking customer relationships to the next levelto be sure in pursuing their icrm opportunities companies cannot try to be all things to all people an aircraft manufacturer might learn that a customer is not happy with his legal representation but that doesn t mean the manufacturer should acquire a law firm to offer legal services but we do believe many companies have insights from the customer data they collect to identify customer needs that they cannot resolve themselves what s more we believe these companies could introduce those customers to other customers of theirs that stand to be rewarded with both future revenue and increased loyalty what would icrm look like in practice large companies would take existing customer data and adopt protocols for collecting new data on unfulfilled customer needs needs that go beyond their ability to satisfy then they would use that data to generate insights about potential business synergies among customers it s important not to confuse icrm with similar sounding models icrm is not synonymous with consumer to consumer c2c commerce c2c applies to platforms like ebay and craigslist that let consumers buy and sell products and occasionally services from one another typically these relationships are isolated and transactional hopefully each party is satisfied with the transaction but they are unlikely to form an ongoing commercial relationship by contrast part of an icrm program s goal is to help customers forge ongoing and mutually beneficial business relationships there is also a difference in scale while craigslist and ebay can be used for large dollar transactions as the name c2c suggests they mostly enable smaller consumer to consumer transactions icrm could be used for this purpose but its real potential is for larger transactions for example a consulting firm might discover that the ceo of a private equity client likes swiss watches but it would not necessarily use icrm to connect the ceo with another client looking to sell a swiss watch instead it might use icrm to connect the private equity ceo with another client let s say a swiss watch manufacturer looking for an investor in other words the icrm system would generate insights on the ceo s interests and search its customer ecosystem to see if they align with identified business opportunities while c2c platforms offer some protection and guarantees c2c is largely a buyer beware world c2c platforms provide opportunities for participants to rate one another yet buyers and sellers take a leap of faith when doing business they don t know on the other side of the transaction in contrast we envision icrm as a walled garden customers would know that when they do business with another party that party has been vetted and chosen for them by a trusted third party the company running the icrm program some companies have begun to recognize the value of facilitating relationships among customers and have taken small steps in that direction for years large software companies such as oracle sap and salesforce and investment banks such as allen co have held conferences where customers are encouraged to mingle many profitable deals have been struck thanks to connections made at these conferences while these events and the connections they spawn provide mutual benefit to most participants they are not icrm at a conference the onus is on customers to seek each other out they have no way of knowing which of the dozens and sometimes hundreds of attendees would be the best fit for their business needs in contrast an icrm operator would make specific suggestions introducing customers to one or perhaps a few fellow customers that are most likely in the icrm operator s data informed judgment to result in a beneficial business relationship data that supported these matches would also be made available to each party from expense to revenue sourceby operating an icrm program a company would be able to help its customers solve pressing needs grow their businesses and become more profitable as a result customers may start to see the icrm provider as a revenue generator and business partner in this way icrm makes the relationship between the customer and the company operating the icrm system stickier customers will be less likely to move if they know their fellow customers are potential new business opportunities the internet has made it easy for customers to find alternative vendors it has also given out of market players new opportunities to enter service sectors like banking and insurance and quickly siphon off customers consequently customer retention has become even more critical to every company s bottom line studies show that acquiring a new customer costs anywhere from five to times more than retaining an existing one 1to the extent that icrm can improve customer satisfaction it has a good chance of also increasing customer retention a study found that retailers and publishers which increased spending on customer retention in the last one to three years had an almost higher likelihood of increasing market share than those that increased spending on customer acquisition 2how to build an icrm programso what does it take to implement a robust icrm first it requires a digital engine for automating the large scale identification of inter customer business opportunities this engine should be able to incorporate social media monitoring and text analysis many companies monitor social media to keep tabs on customer sentiments and respond to nascent pr problems in an icrm context social media allows companies to identify not just customer complaints but also unmet needs in some cases the company itself might be able to fill those needs in others it could use its icrm program to find another customer that can for example a bank monitoring a customer s facebook feed might learn that its customer is planning an addition to his home for the bank this is a dual opportunity first to provide a loan and second to find building contractors who are also bank customers the bank then could offer to connect suitable contractors to customers who are expanding their homes figure shows how icrm could increase value for a bank customer working as a contractor to reach icrm s full potential you ll need technology that can gather and analyze unstructured data you ll also need to enhance your customer profiling to gain better visibility into the products and services and their quality that your customers can provide to other customers ideally your icrm program should also be able to track these referrals to see whether they have generated the desired business benefits for your customers a key indicator of program success figure what icrm might look like at a bankyou ll also need to decide how hands on you want to be with the administration of the program for example do you want to automate the icrm program so your it systems can compose and distribute messages to customers when data analysis reveals potential matches between unmet needs and qualified providers or do you want a human to vet matches before you make them perhaps your company wants to play a larger role in these connections with a senior manager making the final decision on whether to make the connection and then facilitating introductions with a call or email the path to inter customer relationship management for financial institutionsbanks are commonly organized around product groups so the typical question they ask is who can we sell a cd credit card or home equity line of credit to this product centered approach often leads to uncoordinated inefficient communications with customers secondly there is very little consideration given to individual customer needs or interests the net result is often a disappointing customer response with customers more likely to view marketing activities based on this strategy as an unwelcome intrusion next best action strategy on the other hand is structured around what you know about that individual customer customers are only offered financial products and services relevant to their needs and the bank develops a deeper more valuable relationship with the customer initiating this level of insight for an icrm initiative is not very different from current next best action usage you are providing an offer that if accepted will generate ongoing value for each party in the transaction in the case of icrm that would be the respondent the other customer and the financial institution that initiates the connection how to startto begin an icrm program make sure your crm and cxm systems are identifying customer needs your company can t fill but which other customers might be able to marketing sales and service functions should understand that capturing this data is a business priority the banking industry is well positioned to take the lead in developing and implementing icrm programs the reason is that banks already have processes to vet customer trustworthiness and financial stability customers trust their banks to safeguard their money it would not be a great leap for a bank s customers to extend their trust to fellow customers introduced to them by that bank in addition bank officers often develop personal relationships with a wide network of clients through retail branch networks icrm pioneers should expect to tackle several challenging questions for instance would customers opt in to an icrm program or would they automatically be registered unless they opted out to what extent would the icrm operator vouch for each customer when making a connection and how would the icrm operator respond if a match turned out to be unsuccessful and even acrimonious should the icrm program pull from external databases e g the better business bureau or yelp to help customers assess recommendations how would customers provide feedback on their icrm experience what mechanism could be put in place would that feedback be available to other icrm participants which is the ebay model or would the feedback only be accessible to the icrm administrator as with any new initiative icrm trailblazers will need to experiment to find their way in a world where at some point crm and cxm initiatives are no longer providing significant competitive differentiators companies that gain a first mover advantage in developing icrm

24,even for companies that can afford billions of dollars in it investments the economics of putting information technology in the cloud are undeniable huge capital expenditures turn into operating expenses and the headaches and complexities of running secure data centers becomes someone else s responsibility the testing of crucial but new compute intensive business capabilities can suddenly be done on the spot and on the cheap this is the reason why the coca cola company this year has shifted more than of its it to the cloud and put a for sale sign on its atlanta data center this is also why companies surveyed by jp morgan with it budgets of at least million expect to increase their cloud workloads from to in five years the message is becoming clear for a growing number of global companies the default location for their hardware and software will be the cloud like the office fax machine and the typing pool running it on premises will soon become a quaint notion for many systems of many companies however transferring a company s computing workload to public cloud vendor facilities promises to be anything but easy the companies that tcs is helping do so which include a global chemicals firm a major business information provider and a large industrial manufacturer are immediately confronted with two fundamental questions what exactly should companies move to the cloud first how should they do so without wreaking havoc on their daily business this article addresses these two questions drawing on our experiences and expertise in helping large companies move their it to public clouds what should move to the cloud firstthe economics of shifting it to public cloud vendors data centers are inescapable companies that can easily lift and shift long standing business applications which consume huge amounts of servers storage and other data center technology should be seriously investigating their public cloud options cheered on by their cfos they will be able to turn much of their big annual capital expenditures involved in running their data centers into operating expenditures unfortunately many business applications are not easy to simply lift and shift a company that decides to move a big enterprise resource planning system erp from its data centers to a public cloud runs the risk of significant disruption to its business when it does so and thus it needs to plan accordingly the reason for the disruption is that moving on premises erp to an erp vendor s cloud oracle sap etc essentially is a new implementation of the technology an upgrade to the latest version what is more most erp systems especially those installed years ago have been significantly modified to suit a company s geographic and industry specific needs much of that customized functionality is not likely to be available in a plain vanilla erp cloud offering thus shifting on premises erp to erp in the cloud may entail significant customization of the type that may have taken months or years to do with the on premises version a major chemical company has nearly versions of an erp system in its data centers and each version has been customized to varying degrees moving that system to the cloud is likely to be painful given all the customization that would need to be done on the erp vendor s latest cloud version of the system owing to such extensive customization some companies have decided not to take their erp systems directly to a public cloud but rather to a privately owned cloud one example is qantas australia s largest airline when it was time to upgrade its on premises oracle erp system the airline turned to a private cloud implementation instead of moving to the latest on premises version qantas took advantage of new functionality enhancing user experience in the e business suite through a private cloud this was a huge opportunity to streamline and improve performance said eric pona technology manager for enterprise systems at qantas 3if the plan is to eventually shift your on premises erp platform to the cloud then the least disruptive way is to shift those parts of the enterprise application that adhere more closely to the standard version sold by the erp vendor that is the modules your firm has not extensively customized in many companies these modules are in finance and order management envisioning the critical new computer workloads of the futurewhen many companies think about the cloud they look only at moving applications and it infrastructure that currently run in their data centers what they forget are the whole new applications that suddenly become available because the cost of bringing in the technology to run them has fallen to near zero if your company wants to offer customers a new it intensive product or a new digital way of doing business but hesitates because it requires a huge investment in additional it infrastructure you need to hesitate no more this is possible because the cost of that infrastructure today is no longer an issue you can buy such computing resources by the hour at affordable prices an excellent example is how streaming movie and tv programming pioneer netflix inc was able to scale its streaming video business after launching the business in the company decided three years later that it needed to move its existing technology to a company that was in the data center business amazon web services with the shift to streaming our software needs to be much more reliable redundant and fault tolerant wrote netflix vp of product engineering at the time john ciancutti in a corporate blog post in we could have chosen to build out new data centers build our own redundancy and failover data synchronization systems etc or we could opt to write a check to someone else to do that instead running what he said was one of the biggest cloud computing environments in the world netflix decided its engineers had to focus on product innovation for the customer experience adding that is what differentiates us from our competitors not the increasingly complex and costly data center infrastructure behind it 5a major provider of information to businesses is making a big push to the cloud for a similar reason to give customers better ways for using its data online customers want to rapidly analyze the firm s data and in numerous ways and not wait for the company to do the analysis for them this means providing customers with sophisticated online tools which in turn requires extensive computing power the company is in the process of re architecting those systems and putting them on a public cloud so that customers can get what they need dramatically improving the customer s online experience is also what drove u s based financial services and credit card company capital one financial corp to the cloud the company s cio rob alexander says the company s online banking experience is becoming the most important one for its customers we really need to be great at building amazing digital experiences for our customers rob alexander cio at the billion revenue company said in a conference presentation we have to be great at building software and data products if we re going to win where banking is going 7to be sure netflix capital one and the business information provider mentioned above are not the only companies that now find themselves competing in an online world against ferocious online players perhaps the best illustration of this is that netflix s cloud provider amazon now competes against the company in the world of streaming tv shows and movies those business partners in the cloud are now competitors too a growing number of other firms in industries ranging from automotive manufacturing and banking to media and travel compete today on the basis of the online products and capabilities that they offer in the future car buyers should be expected to increasingly compare cars on the basis of their telematics and infotainment capabilities for instance what one manufacturer s onboard gps system can do that another s cannot do may become a major influence in the buying decision like netflix capital one and the business information company we mentioned automakers too must have the data center resources to compete in a digital intensive world of online business how to move it to the cloudonce you have determined what existing it applications and infrastructure your firm should shift to the cloud and the new it capabilities that should be built in the cloud from the start the next big consideration is how to make that shift based on our cloud migration work with clients we believe you are likely to encounter six situations and urge you to be ready to manage them you will spend at least double the amount of time than you thought to take inventory of your application portfolio we call this the discovery phase to determine what computer applications should be shifted from on premises systems to the cloud cios must first understand exactly what applications are running in their data centers from our experience when a company initially believes it has around applications running across its global business it is often shocked to find out the number is two to three times that many when the audit is done and we are not including personal applications such as excel that are housed on pcs or laptops many of these extra apps are what are referred to as ghost apps because they are so old that the company that developed them either does not support them anymore or is out of business altogether such ghost apps then may need to be entirely rewritten to become cloud versions a major undertaking another business information provider that has been shifting to the cloud discovered a ghost app three years ago the app provided a critical component to managing customer subscriptions the app vendor had gone out of business long ago when the information provider began its transition to the cloud it started with its erp system and left the ghost app untouched expect to re architect a good percentage of cloud applications without having updated design and architecture documents at hand for those applications that you have decided must be revamped for the cloud a new design and a computing architecture be ready to find that the original documents that explain their design and architecture are either missing or grossly outdated this is especially true for custom applications built years ago three years ago according to forrester companies were spending about the same amount on custom applications as they were on packaged applications about for customer apps and for packaged applications out of total spending on applications software in determining which pieces of the applications portfolio should move to the cloud and when companies are likely to find that as much as three quarters of that portfolio are custom applications that is because many applications were built long ago before viable packaged versions existed the problem that such packaged software presents is equivalent to the one that science fiction writer isaac asimov warned about in his writing on robots the machinery still works but nobody knows why today s business applications are very much in the same condition there is no one left in the company who can explain how they work to minimize disruptions to the business cut over in phases defined by business function rather than by data centers the easiest way for many it departments to shift applications and infrastructure to the cloud is to do it one data center at a time but that often is not the easiest way for a company s business functions to shift their systems to the cloud ultimately a shift to the cloud should be a shift that strengthens a company s business functions and products or service offerings not just one that reduces the it cost structure a marketing function s applications for example may reside in multiple data centers as a result shifting to the cloud one data center at a time will force marketers to learn test and use new cloud based systems over a long period of time rather than in a concentrated one better to identify all the marketing applications that should be put in the cloud and then plan their migration in a shorter not extended period of time for the it organization the data center is the logical unit of work especially if a firm s data centers are outsourced to third parties in cloud migrations however the unit of work should be the business function in deciding what business functions should go first determine the connections among applications chances are most applications in a business function are connected to other systems in that function rather than to systems in other functions other than of course those cross functional erp systems ensure applications that are tightly knotted to other applications are identified and moved concurrently in batches functional applications that are integrated with erp systems should be migrated to the cloud together so that the business function is not disrupted on two different occasions recognize the idiosyncratic it needs of different geographies when determining how to batch the cloud migration data privacy and other information security laws may vary from country to country and in different continents too for example overlooking europe s rules on employee data privacy may create problems if that data is not kept in the country where a company s on premises system was located if you have country specific applications put them into a single batch and do them all at once the professionals behind cloud migrations must pay close attention to data privacy and security regulations know in advance how you will test your new cloud systems before migrating to them you need to have a strategy for stress testing the software early on a chemical company that is moving to the cloud will have one vendor s responsibilities in testing to end at so called smoke testing an initial testing to ensure that the most critical aspects of the system work well however more advanced levels of testing should be in place for example integration testing to test how multiple applications work together and performance testing which typically include testing an application s connection to a network and its response time for users it is one thing to have a cloud system operating on aws or microsoft s azure platform it is a much bigger challenge to have a part of an application on one cloud platform and another running an on premises system the networks that link those two systems can become huge performance issues taking the lighter paththe number of companies moving down the path to the cloud has risen from a trickle to a torrent every company now needs to evaluate the opportunities of public clouds big reductions in it capital expenses and the availability of enormous amounts of online computing power all without significant capital costs the meteoric rise of netflix in the world of streaming video and capital one s moves in the fast evolving landscape for online banks show what happens to companies that read the tea leaves early the public cloud becomes a key competitive tool even upstart taxi icon uber was reportedly looking this spring to put some of its extensive technology infrastructure into a public cloud 9to determine an effective path to the cloud companies must have solid answers to the questions of what to move to the cloud and how to do so without upending the business their answer to the first question needs to factor not only what current systems should be ported over to the cloud but also what new previously impractical digital capabilities are now possible as the computing infrastructure for it can now be rented not purchased with a cloud strategy in hand the next step is about anticipating the bottlenecks of taking inventory of a potentially massive application portfolio the cloud strategy should also include re architecting many cloud applications minimizing disruptions to business functions understanding the connections among applications knowing how it needs may vary by geography and determining how to test new cloud systems before cutting over to them companies that are well prepared for these challenges will make a

25,whether it s a series of tweaks or a wholesale transformation every customer experience initiative will run into roadblocks along the way they can throw the program off track or even derail it altogether such bumps include turf battles among customer facing functions over optimistic expectations of untested technologies and poor project management however one factor can help a cx initiative withstand even multiple setbacks along the way a deeply involved ceo from our client work and from studying transformations at other companies we ve seen five instrumental roles that ceos have played in successful cx initiatives consensus builder experience unifier influential designer chief customer advocate and thought leader i ll examine each role and illustrate them with examples from such companies as domino s pizza burberry pepsi virgin group and airbnb one factor can help a cx initiative withstand even multiple setbacks along the way a deeply involved ceo consensus builder convincing key constituencies to go alongsome cx initiatives cost companies a great deal of money and even when the potential returns are projected to be multiple times the investment these programs can create anxiety among key stakeholders board directors division leaders functional heads and highly influential cfos in these cases a convincing ceo can be the only force that gets the program off the ground the experience of domino s pizza inc ceo patrick doyle is a perfect case in point domino s is an ann arbor michigan based company that delivers pizza direct from its pizza making operations around the u s and other countries to consumers businesses homes and offices back in the company s growth had stalled and its share price was less than from comments that customers made on social media its phone lines and other places doyle got the message domino s pizza wasn t good enough that year he even went public with such comments in a tv commercial e g worst excuse for pizza i ever had he vowed to fix it but after customers the next group doyle had to convince was domino s franchisees the business people who owned of the chain s u s locations back then this would not be an easy group to persuade their businesses were hurting badly the great recession of hadn t helped and part of making the pizza better and delivering it faster required them to make substantial investments so how did doyle do it through extensive consumer research that showed the pizza had to get much better and customers would embrace the improvements that corporate had experimented with it took months to research and analyze what the company needed and get buy in from franchisees but it worked the fundamental starting point for getting buy in … was very thoroughly thinking through how it is going to affect everybody he said if you do that then it starts to get a lot easier … they are going to understand that you have done that work says doyle you want to build consensus as often as you can that s what gives you the |credibility to every once in a while hope that most of the people will line up behind you 2today domino s is vibrant again with a stock price approaching a share revenue of billion in more than three times the number in and profits of more than million unifier getting everyone on the same pageone reason why many companies launch organization wide cx transformations is that the experiences they offer are highly inconsistent this happens frequently in industries such as retailing and restaurants where customers in one country or a region of that country encounter very different experiences or even a very different set of products one company suffering from this malady was uk apparel retailer burberry in back then the company known for its iconic trench coats was growing only a year it was a billion firm at the time its products and store experiences had become highly inconsistent an experience in any given burberry store in the world might be very different from the customer s previous one said angela ahrendts a new ceo brought in that year to turn around the company 5that was a huge problem she believed from apple to starbucks i love the consistency knowing that anywhere in the world you can depend on having the same experience in the store or being served latte with the same taste and in the same cup that s great branding what did ahrendts do she immediately appointed a brand czar christopher bailey to set a global design for all its apparel and its stores she told her management team that anything that the consumer sees anywhere in the world will go through bailey s office no exceptions then to unify the design of products and store experiences ahrendts and bailey started with burberry s famous trench coat a product whose price tag can exceed it was worn by british soldiers in world war i and by hollywood stars in films ever since with products now designed in one place not multiple sites around the world the design team revamped the trench coat to appeal to the next wave of buyers millennials the designers came up with more styles and colors they also united a series of regional company websites into one global platform this global site generates more online visitors every week than the number who walk through the company s stores in total and they had a video produced that showed the trench coat s craftsmanship store salespeople were instructed to play this video on their new ipad tablet devices and many customers were impressed when they watched from apple to starbucks i love the consistency knowing that anywhere in the world you can depend on having the same experience in the store or being served latte with the same taste and in the same cup that s great branding by burberry was back in growth mode revenue had nearly tripled to billion from the number in and operating income more than doubled to million from million ahrendts skill in unifying the cx brought new glory to burberry and her reputation for creating a great and highly consistent cx attracted the eye of apple inc which hired her in to run its then billion a year global business6 of apple stores influential designer putting a thumbprint on the experience to cometwo ceos have played important roles this decade in helping design their companies customer experiences pepsi and airbnb around pepsi ceo indra nooyi was perplexed by the company s flat growth she decided to take a customer s view of the problem and went to a grocery store every week as a mom not as a ceo to answer this question what products really speak to me from a cx standpoint pepsi s products did not nooyi then told the executives who report to her to take a camera and an empty photo album and snap photos of products that they thought were designed well the results were disappointing only a few brought back photo albums some had their wives take pictures many did nothing at all they didn t know what design was nooyi wrote in a harvard business review article a few pepsi executives thought design was merely about the colors and logos used in packaging they considered it to be like putting lipstick on a pig as opposed to redesigning the pig itself she said at that point nooyi realized pepsi had to hire a top designer in that person mauro porcini became the first chief design officer in the company s year history in the past user experience wasn t part of our lexicon nooyi said focusing on crunch taste and everything else now pushes us to rethink shape packaging form and function porcini has since been helping pepsi design the entire cx from seeing the product on a shelf to the pepsi fountain machine where customers pour their drinks since then pepsi s cx design initiative ignited by ceo nooyi has had impact it s helped a new beverage product mountain dew kickstart generate more than million in revenue in two years not an easy feat in the food industry it comes in a slim can and tastes nothing like the old mountain dew and it appeals to women who want a lower calorie but tasty beverage moreover the company no longer outsources design to marketing agencies pepsi has brought the design function inside and design thinking into nearly every major company decision airbnb s ceo brian chesky took a similar but different approach in he read in walt disney s biography about how the legendary cartoonist created the snow white movie in the mid 1930s storyboarding the tale before putting it to his cartoon animators chesky and his management team decided to do something similar storyboard the experiences of their three main stakeholders hosts the people who rent their apartments condos or houses guests and employees when you have to storyboard something the more realistic it is the more decisions you have to make he says who exactly are the customers what emotions do they have when they purchase and use your product by storyboarding the travelers experience at an airbnb rental the company thought more clearly about who the customer is are they men or women are they young or old do they live in cities suburbs or in the countryside pepsi has brought the design function inside and design thinking into nearly every major company decision interestingly only two of the storyboards drawn by a pixar artist that chesky hired were about a traveler at an airbnb rental unit that helped the management team identify new opportunities to pursue one of which is travel excursions after storyboarding the cx they realized that many vacations can be dull through subsequent research they found that many customers would opt for memorable excursions such as attending costume parties and midnight bike rides 11by initiating storyboard based design thinking into the airbnb cx ceo chesky set the company into hyper growth mode the privately held firm generated a profit of more than million on billion in revenue in according to one media report and airbnb is projected to quintuple that revenue by not bad for a company whose latest round of venture funding valued it at billion customer advocates putting the customer in the design roomno company is as focused on customers as online retailer amazon com its ascension to become one of the world s biggest retailers in bricks or clicks billion in revenue is a testimony to constantly sweating the details of how it deals with customers as founding ceo jeff bezos told a reporter we re not competitor obsessed we re customer obsessed we start with what the customer needs and we work backwards that relentless focus on customers remains at amazon regardless of whether the company is making money we don t focus on the optics of the next quarter bezos has said we focus on what is going to be good for customers i think this aspect of our culture is rare 14in amazon s early days one way bezos kept the customer front and center was by placing an empty chair in the room for management meetings he designated that chair as the customer s chair and the most important person in the room that set amazon s early mindset of being customer obsessed thought leader ceo as cx expertit does a company significant good when the very top of the organization demonstrates an affinity for customers and a company s ceo is its best public thought leader several ceos have played this role before during and after their companies cx overhauls and very publicly one of the best known is virgin group s founder sir richard branson every action branson takes and every word he speaks whether the cameras are on or off reflect his commitment to creating an exceptional experience for both his customers and employees said marketing consultant carmine gallo after accompanying branson on his airline s first flight from los angeles to las vegas 15branson s reason for writing and speaking prolifically is brand management it shows just how customer obsessed the virgin group is the obsession has helped build an organization that generates billion a year in revenue and employs more than people a good leader doesn t get stuck behind a desk branson told gallo anybody can sell a cup of coffee anyone can buy an airplane and we all buy planes from the same manufacturers but there the difference stops if you fly on a virgin plane … you know you re going to have a completely different experience branson has been highly visible for years as a public advocate in the sectors where his 60+ companies have competed airlines music banking cable tv and beverages to name a few he appears to write in his blog every day he published a book in on leadership the virgin way and an autobiography three years before that losing my virginity he has more than million followers on linkedin a professional social network for which he has authored nearly articles since he also has his own twitter account with million followers one that he doesn t delegate as a well published ceo branson has helped the company become known for customer excellence virgin boasts of brand recognition in the 90th percentile in the uk the u s france australia and other countries 17there are at least three other good reasons for ceos to become more visible in cx initiatives one is that when the big boss is passionate about something the rest of the organization tends to get passionate too another is that when that boss is a key contributor it forces the executive with daily oversight in this case the head of cx to raise her game she needs to show that she knows more than the boss about cx finally it immeasurably helps any cx initiative to have a well informed and influential tie breaker on big decisions and you should fully expect that a cx transformation will bring many of those decisions to the fore in these five ways ceos can play highly influential roles

26,a few years ago two airlines announced a merger they said would bring tremendous synergies and increases in flights for customers with a doubling of flights the extra coverage came quickly but the synergies did not that is because they were difficult to secure crucial decisions on which pricing and other key business systems to choose how to reduce duplications in business processes and their supporting it infrastructure and how to merge staffs the integration took months longer than the companies expected and mistakes were made a superior pricing system was discarded for an inferior one valuable employees left in droves and more unfortunately stories such as this one are still common today companies that merge with others are unable to rapidly integrate it intensive business processes systems and functions they wind up paying a steep cost to be sure mergers and acquisitions have always been and will always be a powerful tool for companies to get lighter to generate more revenue at less proportional cost and the most successful mergers are ones in which the efficiencies happen quickly the pursuit of such synergies is a core reason why global m a has continued to race along at a breakneck pace since from to of global gdp 1it is no surprise then that acquiring companies increasingly are scrutinizing the potential synergies before and after the acquisition those include business processes that are it intensive and which can be combined such as online marketing data centers and it infrastructure and the professionals to keep the processes and systems going given that information technology spending is one of the single largest categories of costs nowadays achieving the synergies can do much to improve the bottom line and sometimes even the top line in the first year in fact mckinsey company estimates that to of post merger synergies are related to combining such it related activities in healthcare it found of synergies come directly from lowering it infrastructure expenses reducing it personnel and gaining bigger volume discounts from it suppliers but in financial services the prize is even bigger of the synergies can come from combining two companies it activities another can be achieved from what mckinsey called it enabled moves for example reducing finance and hr expenses through connecting their systems cutting logistics costs through optimizing distribution routes and more cross selling by integrating customer data 2but doing all this in a short period of time can be a nightmare with unintended consequences mckinsey s research found most it related merger issues were not fully resolved even in the early stages of post merger planning another study conducted in found it integration to be ignored in four out of five acquisitions more than a third of the companies surveyed did not think they would integrate the it functions within two years after their mergers 3this is not at all a surprise to us recently a multilbillion dollar electronics company that was about to make several acquisitions turned to us for advice it was not sure what to do with the it functions and it intensive business processes of those firms and whether and how to combine them with its own it staff combining business processes and it departments post merger can be fraught with hazards unless both companies have prepared for it long in advance it is like training to run a marathon if you are about to run your first one after only a few of weeks of training you are unlikely to finish the miles preparing your organization for a merger just like preparing for a marathon requires extensive planning and preparation months before the event begins this applies to the parties on both sides of the deal if you are not prepared three major problems can ensue much longer times to generate synergiesbetter business processes systems and technologies typically those of the company being acquired being discarded in favor of inferior systems even when the superior systems provide distinct competitive advantagesan exodus of highly valuable business process and it peoplethis article provides an overview of the preparation that will be necessary for companies that make multiple acquisitions cios of both companies involved in the m a must understand this process if their systems and staffs are to survive the two cios must thoroughly understand their departments assets costs and performance why due diligence often falls shortwhy are the business process and it implications of acquisitions too often underappreciated in deal planning from our experience it is because the parties responsible for identifying acquisitions investment bankers and making them work management consulting firms are focused elsewhere in due diligence the focus is on two companies operating models products services markets and distribution channels the finance departments are looking at numbers yet all too often no one is looking closely at it intensive business processes and it operations and the it leaders at these companies are rarely involved but that is changing now in fact some of the best companies at integrating businesses after mergers private equity firms are paying close attention to combining it intensive business processes and related systems post acquisition companies that merge it intensive processes effectively make it a core competency of the overall m a plan not a muscle that they develop and exercise only when a new deal is at hand rather they train for m a as if it is a marathon they will run for the foreseeable future it enables them to finish the race every time there is a deal and quickly to accomplish this companies need to possess strong capabilities in evaluating a target acquisition s it intensive processes infrastructure and business process and it professionals and ironically they need to have an even stronger understanding of their own capabilities otherwise when asked to make apples to apples comparison between their infrastructure and a target companies infrastructure they will not know which one is better companies that best integrate their business processes and it after a merger also possess an overall philosophy about the best ways to manage such operations especially the steps that make integration faster less risky and less expensive those that do this right can integrate these operations in six months or less rather than the twelve to eighteen months it often takes the six practices that accelerate m afrom helping a number of companies make such merger integration work we have found six practices to be crucial1 building an m a center of excellence large companies have built centers of excellence coes for many functions and activities finance supply chains and customer support operations for example industrial manufacturer 3m has supply chain coes that help it manufacture and distribute its products in new international markets such coes employ a core staff that works full time on continually honing their skills and a playbook that defines the elements and steps of their coe s topic focus few coes exist today in big companies for m a in general much less the it related operations that are merged but to become highly accomplished at doing it quickly companies need a coe that continually refines its practices based on the latest acquisitions creating stringent and demanding metrics for synergies time is the great killer of potential synergies from cost savings new revenue from cross selling and so on in merging it related operations moving fast is key to getting such benefits but this means setting an aggressive timetable for deciding which it intensive business processes applications infrastructure and personnel to keep for merging the systems and reducing the data center footprint one global chemical company has conducted studies to determine best practices in m a integration especially to understand how fast such operations of two companies can be merged all this is analogous to the best marathoners they always pay careful attention to their race times and practice times software companies like oracle and sap that have made many acquisitions over the years have become skilled at merging other software companies business processes and systems onto their platforms quickly just five years ago oracle could integrate most acquisitions in six months or less intimately knowing your operational infrastructure in the merger of the two airlines mentioned at the beginning of this article the it function of the airline that was purchased put itself at a huge disadvantage after the deal closed because it had not thoroughly documented its performance this was unfortunate because the company had a superior pricing system but it was not prepared to have a bakeoff with the acquirer for this pricing system or any other system the acquirer was known for its cost driven culture the acquired company in contrast was famous for a culture of service excellence shortly after the deal closed the ceo of the acquirer asked his two cios to benchmark their departments it performance and evaluate each one s pricing systems the acquiring company had an inferior system but because the cio was well prepared having done rigorous analyses of his function and its systems including his pricing system that system won despite having a better system the acquired company lost out because its cio could not answer important questions such as how many systems would be affected in the merger an answer of hundreds was not nearly precise enough having an in depth and documented understanding of a company s infrastructure business processes systems core data their performance dependencies on other systems etc alone can save to of the time it takes to integrate two big it departments when it is in hand the analysis the bake off should be able to happen in a month when that data is not there it can take many months to pull it together possessing all the pertinent facts about your infrastructure will greatly reduce the chances that superior systems and people go by the wayside the victims of political decisions based on whose leader is the superior storyteller adhering to a philosophy of standardized enterprise systems and the business processes they support much has been written in the past for the need for global corporations to implement standard enterprise systems erp crm supply chain management and hr yet far too many companies still use a mishmash of enterprise packages or even contort software from the same company in order to please local interests this is a huge impediment to rapidly integrating it in a merger it is much easier to integrate the enterprise systems of a company with a standard oracle or sap system than it is to merge five to ten flavors of those systems being prepared for the m a marathon requires companies to harmonize their own enterprise systems to fall back on one standard in each business process standardizing the way data is collected and formatted and the way business processes are run will also go a long way to make integration easier this also makes documenting and benchmarking your operations far easier for example if you have only one sales planning system and the same version of it across your company it is much easier to document its performance with different flavors of the system or to be sure ten different packages altogether the complexities of evaluating and integrating them just went up by a factor of ten maintaining a narrow integration focus a large company can have dozens even hundreds of business processes and supporting information systems but rest assured that they all do not have the same value in keeping customers happy and competitors at bay companies that announce shortly after a merger that they will benchmark or more business processes and systems across two organizations are asking for mountains of trouble that work will require dozens or hundreds of analysts months of time and lots of money moreover only a few processes truly matter to a company s marketplace performance the pricing system of the aforementioned airline company for example is what distinguished its financial performance as well as its customer service in most companies to of their processes and systems are commodities infrastructure that does not distinguish the company only to are core to competitive differentiation during a merger both parties need to focus their integration efforts on that to being prepared for the m a marathon requires companies to harmonize their own enterprise systems going back to the airline example had the acquiring firm focused only on the pricing systems at the outset it would have had more time to determine whose systems should prevail but it did not focus on pricing it evaluated dozens of systems and processes concurrently the result was a hasty decision that led to choosing the wrong pricing system the lesson decide which of your processes and systems are in the core to that really matter then spend to of your time deciding on how to integrate them embracing m a as a fact of life and continuous m a improvement as a core competency many executives regard the time spent to make a merger work as a negative experience but for many companies especially those in mature and fast consolidating markets m a is unavoidable in these firms the mindset must change m a is a necessity to keep them competitive at the global chemical company mentioned earlier the cio and his boss recognized the firm had to make a near steady stream of acquisitions and divestitures that helped their staffs view their m a activities as a positive and a competence they had to keep improving that leads to the second point here after your company has established its m a center of excellence it cannot sit back and let that knowledge become static the world of information technology changes more quickly than most imagine better technologies emerge requiring a fresh look at how they can help a company market sell and manufacture its offerings new business process and it skills are required and companies now have many more options in building it intensive capabilities for example many companies still do not understand the growing capabilities of public clouds as they are still pondering how many servers and other it infrastructure they will need for their computing workload more of such infrastructure is becoming available outside your data center if you are basing your technology budget on an on premises model it is likely to become outdated at some point only the highly prepared win the m a raceexperienced marathoners train for race day after the race is over they soon begin preparing for the next marathon companies that make m a a key growth strategy need to take the same approach they need to prepare rigorously for the day when they buy another company and hope to reap the substantial benefits from streamlining their it intensive operations companies that rise up to this challenge will have a powerful advantage in a world driven by scale and

28,tcs what are the key ways in which manufacturing companies have simplified their business models in the past few years milind lakkad several distinct models are visible in the marketplace the first on the product side companies have dramatically reduced the total cost of managing multiple products for example in the car industry by designing platforms that they apply across models this lets companies simplify product lines as well as supply chains supplier consolidation and harmonization of components contributes significantly towards this effort similarly in the customer facing areas of sales and services companies have made it significantly easier for customers to do business with them by integrating all potential touch points offering a complete range of parts and services online with customer friendly self service options reduces the total cost of conducting business and enhances customer satisfaction changes like these bring manufacturers closer to the ideal paradigm of design anywhere build anywhere and sell anywhere tcs how are manufacturing companies lightening the business model and generating new revenue streams by solving additional customer problems lakkad new age technology is enabling manufacturers to explore and exploit new business models two examples come to mind the first a large industrial power equipment manufacturer seeks to generate services revenue secured via long term contracts by offering what matters most to its customers equipment up time by monitoring and predicting the behavior of the installed equipment using cloud based big data analytics the company heads off equipment problems for customers and quickly addresses any issues these exclusive services are offered at a premium elsewhere a diversified manufacturing firm has started its journey to become a software centric enterprise by monetizing insights gleaned from data that resides on its products in the field these insights can be shared with the customer for performance enhancements for example tuning airplane engine performance for specific and dynamic flying conditions in order to save on fuel costs the manufacturer takes a share of the savings accrued tcs what stands in the way of further simplification of business models for manufacturing companies lakkad companies face both internal and external barriers while adopting simpler business models from an internal perspective years of capital intensive investments limit a company s ability to exit current business models and embrace new ones manufacturing companies typically carry over significant costs from the past nevertheless companies are trying various capex to opex models including contract manufacturing divestitures and the like from an external perspective joint venture and merger and acquisition deals which are frequent in the industry can create new barriers as companies strive to harmonize business operations ambitious convergence initiatives designed to harness the core strengths of both organizations will fail without strong executive sponsorship and strategic focus whether a company faces internal or external barriers managing change across a diverse workforce poses its own challenges tcs how different will a typical manufacturing company s business model look five years from now lakkad the advent of the internet of things changes the picture significantly enabling the production of smart connected products that let manufacturers be in touch with customers throughout the entire life of the product first let us look at business model change driven by this phenomenon connected products let the manufacturer disintermediate the channel and transform from being a business to business b2b player to a business to business to consumer b2b2c player this paradigm shift allows manufacturers to work on new business models especially around services for years distributors and intermediaries captured the services revenue while the manufacturer capitalized only on the sale of the asset now the manufacturer can gain annuity revenue from services which also cushions against cyclical business downturns in five years one can expect the manufacturing business model to be a mix of diversified services businesses driven by a software enabled enterprise the other big model shift is the concept of extended mobility driven by connected cars the emergence of the shared car concept is creating a new business model which will require auto manufacturers to establish new ways to engage customers in five years we would not be surprised to see a significant portfolio of auto manufacturer revenues coming from this new channel which a few years ago was unimaginable,manufacturing how to lighten up business models
29,companies today must get smarter faster and lighter at ever increasing speed this challenge will weigh most heavily on top management at big organizations both at the corporate and divisional levels they risk making their firms and themselves obsolete if they cannot learn new business models new strategies and new ways to organize work even new ways of thinking more quickly than in the past the half life of business knowledge is quickly diminishing accelerated by game changing technologies that enable companies to transform themselves quickly as the world changes last year when asked about the most important trait of a successful leader general electric ceo jeff immelt answered that it is the ability to learn new things you need to be a learner he told fortune magazine if you want to be successful you have got to have an antenna up all the time and you have got to be open to new ideas you have got to be grabbing every new thought you can come up with and you can never feel like you are safe in anything you do that is why ge spends billion every year on education and training 1it is also why other companies are now upping their commitments to more regularly updating the mindsets of their top people executives who believe their biggest learning days are in the past will be in for a rude awakening as an increasing number of leading academics business magazines and ceos like immelt are saying so how must executive learning change to keep executives and their companies competitive it needs to go beyond developing the skills that are relatively timeless project management personal communications time management etc it also requires a clear understanding of the current shape of the business the future trends that will reshape it and most importantly executives ability to challenge and change how they think billion consumers today actively use social media and billion use smartphonesbefore examining how executive learning needs to change let us first look at why today s prevailing business wisdom will not have the shelf life of the wisdom that preceded it the rapidly declining half life of business knowledgemany companies today are under unprecedented pressure to become smarter faster and lighter however if senior executives operate under obsolete notions about how to achieve those goals their initiatives will fall short they could even fail altogether how so consider the world of consumer products marketing given that billion consumers2 today actively use social media and billion use smartphones marketing strategies and tactics have undergone a sea of change renowned global brand builders such as procter gamble nestle and unilever have dramatically altered the ways they create awareness and demand in the last years they and other big consumer firms have deep partnerships with companies that were not around at the turn of the 21st century or were in their infancy facebook google twitter and alibaba to name just a few just consider how fast the world of nestle s senior marketers has evolved in investor presentations today the billion food water and chocolates giant uses terms that would have mystified both wall street and madison avenue in the 1990s global mobile app consumer engagement platform end to end econtent lifecycle and digital acceleration team to name a few in fact billion of nestle s business in came from selling directly to consumers online a business whose revenue has grown an average annually since 5business functions outside of marketing could tell a similar story of rampant alterations in the ways they work especially customer service r d and sales the cost to a company of a top management team that operates with an outdated picture of the world can be severe yet it is perfectly understandable how it happens the world is shifting under executives feet far faster than ever but some do not feel it yet the signs are everywhere here are three of the most significant ones percentage of companies on fortune list that disappearedthe shrinking fortunes of very big companies we all know that thousands of small companies disappear every year but even the biggest companies are succumbing or at least falling off their lofty perches faster between and of the companies on the fortune list disappeared up from that fell off the list by what might make even more than disappear by the acceleration of technology in a survey the magazine asked fortune ceos about their companies biggest challenges they rated the rapid pace of technological change as no what is more said that in the next five years their firms would change even more than they had in the last five years why do so many large companies lose their way they lose touch with the world around them an explosion of better ideas about how to run a business articles published in academic journals number of academic periodicals so many more ideas are out there today about how to optimize a business especially ideas based on academic research unlike less tangible signs of tumult this one is easier to measure the total number of articles published in academic journals jumped between and from million to million in the last years the number of academic periodicals including business has more than doubled from in to over a year ago more knowledge means more theories and more approaches to how businesses should work how diseases should be addressed how social issues should be tackled and so forth with so many more competing ideas about how business should be conducted it is becoming much easier to be guided by obsolete concepts far reaching changes in virtually every profession percent of advertising dollars spent online 1995–2018 projected you only have to look at marketing to see how prevailing practices are becoming obsolete faster in every business domain twenty years ago internet advertising was largely a foreign concept print and broadcast media were where chief marketing officers and their advertising agencies spent the marketing dollars fast forward to and that picture changes drastically online advertising seen on desktop and mobile devices commands of the global advertising pie and is projected to snare by if that happens the internet will top tv as the largest advertising medium advertising executives who think they are still largely in a mad men world of print campaigns and tv jingles should think again in many ways the world has changed even faster in fields such as it manufacturing research development and customer service along with these three signs many other signs tell us that a great deal of today s business knowledge is not likely to be right next year or the year after but whether you believe them or not many companies have already acted as if they are a fact of life over the past three decades the data shows that companies worrying that their executives knowledge may go the way of the dinosaur have built their own places of higher education in only u s companies had corporate universities or places where they could educate employees and develop skills general motors was among the first of these developing its in house program in by the 1970s others had followed suit such as fiat by that number grew to and then it doubled again to about by today an estimated companies around the world have their own formal universities 10companies that are not building college campus type buildings are sending their executives off to accredited business schools in large numbers to meet the voracious demand for executive education programs more business schools are offering them the percentage of business schools worldwide with non degree executive education programs has risen steadily from in to in 11all of this demonstrates that companies are worried their executive teams may be operating under outdated beliefs about their markets customers competitors and how to do business the worries are valid it is natural for highly successful executives at highly successful companies to rest on their laurels and believe they have all the answers bill taylor co founder of fast company magazine and author of the new book simply brilliant how great organizations do ordinary things in extraordinary ways explains it this way why is it so hard to make deep seated meaningful long lasting change in long successful companies the longer you have been in a discipline and the higher up the ranks you go … it becomes hard to open your eyes and minds to new ways of solving longstanding problems … it takes a real act of leadership willpower to make sure that what you know does not limit what you can imagine 12as taylor believes leaders should take a gut check to understand whether they are learning as fast as the world is changing five ways in which executive learning needs to changeis your team that fast and if not how can you help them stay current with the fundamental changes in the way your industry customers and competitors operate first help them understand that learning does not end after graduation or after a promotion to the c suite in fact one could argue that learning today must be accelerated for those people who are shaping the destiny of a large company here is some other advice based on the practices of companies that are ahead in the game of keeping executive worldviews current get the best educators from the best sources companies such as unilever apple and ge sought out prominent business school professors to lead their executive education initiatives unilever went to professors at business schools such as cambridge university insead and others to design and teach the programs on its two campuses one in london the other in singapore apple hired the dean of yale s business school joel podolny to run its little publicized executive learning program apple university getting the very best experts in each field will mean cherry picking them from multiple institutions not just one make the learning immediately applicable not theoretical so executives use the new insights right away the corporate university at german airline lufthansa continually revises its curriculum so that it is in line with the company s strategy 14create education that is irresistible and not optional continual learning is no longer a luxury that executives can do when they find the time but consider highlighting the carrot rather than the stick executives should know that a growing body of leadership research ties the ability to learn to promotion potential for example research from executive recruiter korn ferry has found that people with high learning agility get promoted much faster twice as many promotions over years as managers with low learning agility 1learning agility refers to someone s interest and ability to grow from experience and use that learning to succeed in a new experience make learning illuminating not dreary executives have short attention spans they also have day jobs it is hard for them to learn often radical sounding ideas about the business and their area of expertise if the course content is arcane boring and not visual i e mostly text what is more it needs to be presented in shorter more digestible chunks expecting executives to learn about the a to z of digital strategy in six months of courses is unrealistic that learning at the least needs to come in smaller but highly informative and highly useful pieces overall corporate educators must make sure the learning content passes the wow test does it make sense is it interesting does it provoke and does it instruct on what to do next ensure it s convenient if executives are to continually learn important new things about their field the education must be highly accessible expecting managers to go offsite or even just into the next building for days or weeks at a time is not realistic the rapid rise of online learning so called massive open online courses shows it is indeed possible to educate executive s right at their desks or on their smartphones more corporate education has to be delivered that way rather than at a monthly visit to the corporate training facility as digital competition continues to force established companies to re think their business models and how they operate they will have to treat executive learning as a necessity not a luxury doing so will increase their ability to win at the now perpetual game of getting smarter faster and lighter ge accessed july wearesocial com january accessed july emarketer worldwide internet

make much faster changes in their product service offerings and the business processes that support them companies need to implement agile principles and approaches throughout the enterprise enterprise agility encompasses all components of an enterprise s design and management its strategy people processes technology and infrastructure the goal is to deliver what customers want and to continuously adapt to market and customer changes as with all transformations this is a tall order it involves altering the dna of the organization and how it senses and responds to the marketplace asking every function in a large organization to adopt agile principles all at once is a huge undertaking likely to produce both false starts occasional resistance and cynicism this is the holistic challenge of embracing enterprise agility to create a flexible adaptable responsive and more competitively fit organization achieving enterprise agility takes commitment it means investing in people skills in new tools and technology and in a workplace organized to encourage teamwork it requires making the organization s culture flatter it calls for adjusting decision making styles including the speed at which people make them it means spending time and resources on change management to sustain these new ways of working the effort pays off enterprise agility improves collaboration it leads to a higher quality of products and services delivered it speeds time to market for those offerings it improves processes for creating demand through marketing sales and r d and for generating supply through production and distribution it strengthens customer service it boosts productivity and the need for enterprise agility is clear established companies are learning that digital startups have three distinct advantages that enable them to make rapid inroads into markets once ruled by incumbents these digital natives do not have to compete on the same terms with the same strategies business processes and legacy systems as incumbents to pursue market opportunities for example to compete with taxi services uber and lyft do not have to maintain a fleet of vehicles can develop digital systems far more rapidly using testing and data from customer trials to ensure a higher likelihood of success consider amazon s continual adjustments to its web store offerings typically develop these digital systems rapidly using lean agile approaches as do airbnb spotify and google among others rather than traditional sequential time consuming waterfall project management while the business urgency to create an agile enterprise is clear it s unrealistic to ask every executive running every business function to adopt agile approaches immediately eventually organizations that wish to compete in a digital world will have to embrace agile as a new way of working but because the transition is a significant shift in how business process and product managers operate and what they value asking them to do so at once is likely to be met with resistance figure differences between traditional and lean agile organizationsa better approach to an enterprise s agile transformation begins with a tight focus on a core set of activities within a business function making those activities agile and then demonstrating their benefits to the rest of the organization and then replicating that work elsewhere to scale it across the organization we call this embracing agile at the core of value generation for the enterprise and using success to enable change to ripple across until it transforms the entire business the road to any large endeavor begins with a thoughtful assessment to determine where to begin where to begindeciding which part of an enterprise to make agile first should start with an agile readiness assessment to identify the business area best positioned to adopt agile practices this area will become the agile pilot for the enterprise and as agility depends upon a foundation that makes it possible to develop and test new products and services iteratively and quickly this determination should start with an examination of the existing ways in which people are organized the culture in which they work and the processes technologies and tools they use to accomplish that work figure examples of companies that have embedded agile in their businessfigure provides a simplified view it includes characteristics in place that describe a traditional organization or functions within an organization before it adopts lean agile principles along with the characteristics that describe organizations and functions after they have adopted them a critical consideration in discussing how enterprises become agile is noting that it is not an all at once proposition figure shows how companies have incorporated agile techniques in parts of their businesses to meet specific business needs performing an agility assessment calls for analyzing the organization s work activities and separating them into two categories pattern a applies to the parts of the organization working on software development maintenance and operations this includes areas such as it operations and quality assurance testing these it centric functions are poised to adopt lean agile principles as well as agile methods and practices by lean and agile principles we use the terms outlined in the scaled agile framework 4respect for people and culture in which people perform work to benefit customers flow describing how teams achieve optimized work processes to create continuous and sustainable value innovation in which producers create new products for customers to validate a focus on relentless improvement agile methods include scrum in which the product owner works with team members to identify priorities for development sprints periods lasting a set period of time in which the team develops minimally viable products to test and stand up meetings daily or regular team meetings to get fast status updates while in most organizations it s common for pattern a activities to occur in it centric functions after all agile began as a software development movement they can also occur in other functions some companies will find these activities in sales such as with a customer app or in hr if recruiting is central to that company s business model pattern b applies to business functions such as strategy and planning marketing finance hr r d learning and development and others these functions are well suited to adopt lean agile principles but not necessarily all agile methods the adoption of agile methods and practices should be reviewed for their applicability and real benefits as opposed to force fitting agile to proven business processes selecting an agile pilot projectthe next step after identifying the area of a company to make agile is selecting a pilot project an ideal pilot project should be neither too short to be credible and representative nor too long so the company can see timely outcomes and benefits we typically recommend three month pilots giving the company sufficient time to inspect adapt and adopt lessons after four or more iterations during the project the pilot project should matter to the larger organization but not be a top priority top priority projects will place too much pressure on a project team engaged in what is also a learning exercise on the other hand unimportant projects will not gain adequate commitment by participants and will fail to establish credibility for lean agile approaches a successful pilot project provides proof that lean agile practices are valuable it demonstrates to leaders and the organization that they can execute an agile project in the company s core with a successful pilot complete it s time to build on that experience figure scaling agility across the enterprisespreading lean agile practices to other areasthe decision to bring the benefits of lean agile practices to other areas of the company typically requires choosing between two paths to spread agile approaches across an enterprise companies either can scale lean agile practices vertically within a business unit or horizontally across business units vertical scaling within a business unit calls for adopting lean and agile practices using proven frameworks scaling methods such as the scaled agile framework safe large scale scrum less and disciplined agile delivery dad are all well established examples of frameworks that companies can follow to promote and propagate lean agile practices and methods for example a retailer could first adopt agile for its portfolio of merchandising products in a particular value stream the steps required to make goods for available for sale and then sell them next it would adopt agile methods and practices for supply chain products related to the same value stream horizontal scaling would follow a similar pattern by emulating the successful experience in the company s core in a different business unit bringing lean agile practices to the new functional area for example a company could begin in its development organization and then bring lean agile principles to operations and later to customer service whether scaling horizontally or vertically success factors include creating a competency pool within the organization using a construct such as an agile center of excellence where talented staff can practice agile principles and methods and be available to work on subsequent projects this can help a company disseminate agile approaches effectively business support the goal of spreading lean agile practices throughout the enterprise is nothing less than a thorough transformation in our experience agile enterprise transformation succeeds best when the business drives changes and it works as an equal partner building cross functional agile teams with people possessing the authority to drive change cross functional knowledge will help the team to spread agile ways of working when the company moves from a pilot project in one area to adopting agile ways of working in another this team will create clarity for stakeholders defining both the roles they play and the work they do to initiate the journey to spread agility to other parts of the organization start by using the agile readiness assessment to identify areas for improvement that are well positioned to adopt the new practices then prepare a transformation roadmap for second third and more projects and functional areas organize teams around value streams in the business area so the team s work is focused on projects valuable to customers whether external or internal invest in coaching to help teams learn lean agile practices and methods during projects inspect results and adapt accordingly review progress according to relevant business metrics track outcomes conduct regular retrospectives to identify project areas that met or exceeded their goals and those that could be improved correct course and adapt as required to meet the company s objectives results from the fieldthe examples of two companies that disseminated lean agile principles across their organizations illustrate the kinds of benefits others can expect example a large australian energy companyproblem challenges included new energy options like solar and wind stiff competition from new market players and new energy regulations giving customers more choice in providers solution the energy company adopted agile across the enterprise with the goal of reducing time to market for new products to support frequently changing business priorities it increased its capability to develop fit for purpose solutions to compete in its market and prepared for a major digital transformation driven by its ceo and cio the company s initiative reorganized business and it based on customer experience value streams the company established capacity based agile teams with a core and flex model core team members were helped by people with right skills added as needed it made investments to improve collaboration including redesigning the work floor and strengthening the technology infrastructure to support distributed agile teams it automated software development and operations activities using devops practices results the company achieved a reduction in deployment time for software products a reduction in production incidents that could lead to disruptions and faster resolutions of application problems leading to higher customer loyalty example a large u s retailerproblem traditional project delivery methods were unable to meet business expectations for quality and timeliness functional silos dominated too many interdependencies among applications meant that software products depended on other software products to work making them unreliable and inefficient solution reorganized the enterprise transforming it into a business portfolio based product organization it switched to agile and scaled agile framework delivery methods across all business lines a technology refresh included infrastructure upgrades that supported automation including devops new work spaces were created to improve collaboration and agility for business stakeholders and development teams results the retailer saw an eight fold increase in annual product deployments new product features reached the market faster than before production problems fell by it costs dropped by and it infrastructure improvements led to a reduction in lead times needed for providing required resources time for an agile enterpriselean agile is a proven approach being adopted by all types of enterprises for companies facing new competition especially from non traditional digitally native companies not pursuing lean agile is not an option when starting this journey draw the vision for agility at an enterprise level every company is unique so where to start and how to scale will be different for everyone but prioritizing the need for speed is always the same then experiment learn and adapt and do not look for perfection do not fear failure in agile terms failure is an opportunity to learn refine and improve the organization and the result fail quickly learn and then go fast techtarget searchcio four pillars of paypal s big bang agile transformation

31,while it is very beneficial to have all the team members of small agile teams co located insisting on having all inter related agile teams in the same location is not worth the effort and is unrealistic in today s global business environment in fact in the last article of this issue of perspectives why your agile team is better off dispersed the case for location independent agile tcs makes the case that agile programs whose teams are distributed can more quickly develop new processes and systems that are more on target with customer needs in our own work we have observed several hundred projects that use location independent agile teams given the challenges involved it is clear that one way of working does not fit all projects for example some projects may be best suited to having agile teams co located at least at first while others may succeed best with contributions from different agile teams in many places companies that are new to agile approaches can also benefit from starting with co located teams as they work to build distributed capabilities which model a company chooses will depend on a variety of factors including the business knowledge needed and where it resides whether the work is urgent or has non negotiable constraints and the maturity of the organization s agile development processes there are three aspects to successfully implementing location independent agile teams assess the organization s distribution of business expertise the nature of work and agile maturity choose the right agile working model to meet the organization s needs continuously improve the agile capabilities of the teams to gain the benefits of location independent agile first assess the organizationuse the three criteria referenced above to determine the organization s capabilities for location independent work answer these questions what is the level of business expertise and other skills required and to what extent do they exist at a specific location if a location lacks business expertise it will require more of it to be able to support agile teams there as team members accumulate experience they will build business knowledge making them both more valuable and more able to work as part of a distributed organization how urgent and volatile is the work at first location independent agile teams should focus on work that is neither urgent nor volatile if the work is both if it has non negotiable constraints such as overnight fixes intra day scope changes or regulatory requirements or if there is a need for constant access to the project owner it s best to work with teams in the same location if at all possible how mature is the organization when teams are relatively new to agile approaches team members should be co located having a common understanding of agile culture especially among the leadership indicates the organization can succeed with location independent teams having a clear understanding of the organization s starting point will point leaders to select the best approach for moving forward second choose the right location modelwe have identified four potential models for organizing agile teams ranging from teams that should start in the same location to those that can be effective in a highly distributed arrangement see figure descriptions of the models follow local model this model is best when the teams are new to the business area when continuous access to a product owner is paramount or when regulatory concerns require the project to be executed in a specific geography however when a project or program is ready to scale up enterprises will need to consider evolving to one of the other models minimally distributed model the product owner and a few members of a project or program are located together as one team while the rest of them work together as another inter related team in a different place this model requires the teams to understand the underlying business processes for their product they will still need frequent access to the product owner and infrastructure teams for business decisions and infrastructure privileges when it s time to expand the project or program enterprises using the minimally distributed model will need to adopt one of the remaining two models for quick on boarding of talent in additional locations location independent agile modelfigure four models of location independent agilesignificantly distributed model the product owner and few members of a project or program team are located together as one team while other teams working with them reside in multiple locations enterprises that have already distributed teams with a shared understanding of the business processes of a project or program are well positioned to adopt significantly distributed agile work processes this model not only offers the scale for enterprises to deliver large programs as well as frequent releases by increasing their access to the right talent it also provides for business continuity fully distributed model the product owner may be at any site while the rest of the project or program team members are grouped in agile teams across distributed locations these teams each include product specialists with sufficient business knowledge to drive day to day decisions within a framework defined by the product owner a fully distributed model is useful when enterprises need to empower teams with independent decision making capability such as when business experts do not have enough bandwidth to drive product leadership on a daily basis we have observed that many organizations experience dramatic benefits after successfully deploying one of these four location independent agile models for example location independence makes an enterprise more agile using the minimally distributed model model a large u s retailer with a delivery team of 500+ members in india reduced its it operations costs by and improved end customer satisfaction by in months these benefits resulted from a combination of steps including role rationalization product re architecting and the application of devops practices for automating new product deployment devops is an approach to it software development and operations that emphasizes automation to speed up software building testing and installation location independence makes an enterprise more productive by using all hours available to execute work in parallel across time zones an organization can accomplish more in the same time than co located teams that are limited by an eight hour work day leveraging hour five days a week development coverage with significantly distributed model teams across u s india and mexico a large financial company was able to cut the time it took to introduce new products to market by by sharing skills across multiple teams in different locations companies can accelerate work without requiring business experts to participate in daily decision making one u s retailer was able to complete an integrated channel delivery project in just months with fully distributed teams model by leveraging the domain skills of product specialists in many locations while product owners still have to make prioritization decisions and confirm product acceptance they can delegate significant amounts of knowledge work involved in product development third improve the agile capabilities of teamsorganizations that want to move from the local model to one of the location independent models can improve their agile capabilities in five ways build business knowledge oriented teams at distributed locations consistently seek to optimize each team s product and business expertise by promoting the team structure around business concepts a u s retailer was able to move from a fully co located model to a minimally distributed model in three months by relocating some experienced team members with business knowledge to another location and leveraging their expertise to form a new team around this business knowledge configure teams to take advantage of time zone differences for effective collaboration and communication agile teams need a minimum overlap across time zones calibrate each team s work hours so that as one team heads home another team can pick up the work with enough time for communication to ensure it continues at a steady sustainable pace with minimal confusion take the experience of a leading u s bank as an example the bank had one team in texas and another in chennai india the teams adjusted their hours to overlap based on how much time they needed to resolve their interdependencies they became motivated to improve how they worked to reduce the number of overlapping hours they needed minimize planning overhead an australian retailer synced up the sprints and product releases of its three agile teams reducing the teams planning time by to achieve such results it s critical to automate as much of the teams work as possible using devops automation and design engineering practices create a one team culture teams across the enterprise should use the same agile practices same work and infrastructure privileges and share common work characteristics culture coaches can help geographically distributed teams understand and appreciate their cultural differences ensuring the teams have healthy working relationships plan the right distribution of work across locations organize the work to minimize dependencies across teams while maximizing workflow at a european telecom provider software development teams were originally aligned on horizontal areas such as routers and signal processors when it created agile teams it restructured to focus on business features such as customer gateways thereby reducing dependencies among the horizontal areas and enabling more frequent and value added product releases overcoming skills process and it system challengesas the scale of change involved suggests aligning multiple agile teams located in different time zones and countries is a complex endeavor challenges may emerge involving shortages of the right skills employees adapting to new work processes and a company s it infrastructure to get the most from location independent agile teams an enterprise needs to put people with the right skills in the right places in addition to universal coaching and training in agile practices one way to do this is to train team members in more than one skill for example instead of having some team members who are application developers and others who are testers train some people to be adept at both jobs legacy ways of working and employee attitudes toward them can hinder the cultural change needed to pursue agile some employees will have trouble adapting they can benefit from coaching that goes beyond teaching agile techniques to practicing new roles hands on practice will help them understand the benefits of pursuing agile approaches to their own work lives one important stumbling block to setting up distributed agile teams is frequently the existing enterprise it architecture which may not support agile ways of working the systems that underlie the work of developing and releasing new products must be able to handle increased production loads for example if an agile team has to produce a product in two weeks and the supporting architecture requires more than a two week lead time to schedule a test the agile team will fail to meet its deadline and become demotivated furthermore the ripples of that failure will hurt productivity across other teams and degrade the company s ability to innovate leaders should assess the strength of the company s it architecture when they start planning for agile adoption to identify the necessary improvements capturing the benefits of location independent agileit is possible to take advantage of distributed agile teams and thereby maximize enterprise productivity and innovation but companies need to know how to do it correctly that means knowing yourself your business expertise where it resides and the level of your agile maturity it also means determining the right location model for your work local minimally significantly or fully distributed based on your business s needs goals capabilities and the competitive landscape as your organization gains experience you can move up the ladder toward a more fully distributed model with advancement comes the opportunity to acquire additional benefits from organizational agility as well as the ability to compete more successfully on a global scale,how to make location independent agile work

media and entertainment banking business information and more but even products that must remain physical products and services that customers must experience at a company s place of business hotels airplanes etc are being digitally altered to become much more useful products and services the impact on industries can t be overstated the world is flat author and new york times columnist tom

months not years but that can t be done if such systems are staged funded and scoped in the same manner of the enterprise systems of old companies must now rely on agile cross functional teams that use agile software development methods but that is harder than it sounds and one of the biggest barriers is how agile programs are scoped and funded in short traditional systems budgeting and scoping

33,threatened by digital competition many companies are embracing lean agile approaches to accelerate innovation to remain market relevant and fiscally viable when companies master them these approaches become a competitive advantage in harnessing talent and capability a key tenet of what we call business using lean agile approaches to nurture innovation requires mastering the discipline of generating new ideas and managing the subsequent innovation portfolio based on strategic or other business outcomes sought it means applying lean agile precepts not only in those functions directly involved in the development and delivery of products and services to end customers but also throughout support functions and shared services the meaning of enterprise agilityto match the accelerating speed with which their market sectors are changing companies must take a broader approach to becoming innovative an approach that we refer to as enterprise agility by that we mean an organization that can adapt all the core elements of its business its strategy product and service offerings the business processes that create and fulfill demand for those offerings its people s skills and technology and it infrastructure at the pace that s required to stay competitive and solvent that in turn means adopting a lean agile culture throughout the organization not just in software development while there are three broad dimensions to achieving enterprise agility strategy and process people and culture and tools and technology in this article we discuss the elements that are conducive for innovation strategy formulation to guide the organization s innovation efforts cultural transformation to change values beliefs mindset and behaviors at all levels andfocused experimentation to improve everything let s look at each element strategy formulationa key step in enterprise agility is outlining a company s innovation strategy what it seeks to accomplish through innovation and how this strategy requires executives who are aligned engaged and committed to innovation they must communicate consistent messages across the enterprise about the goals why they matter and how every employee in every function and group can contribute top managers must then encourage the next level of leaders to successively spread contextualize and reinforce those same messages in their business units and functional areas strong governance is another element of the innovation foundation this allows the right distribution of responsibility and accountability and ensures transparency in decision making we recommend establishing a balanced scorecard that is consistent with the enterprise s innovation strategy by measuring the effectiveness of ongoing activities against a list of strategic goals a company can focus on efforts that will deliver a continuous pipeline of innovations cultural transformationbut developing and communicating an innovation strategy is not nearly enough leaders must give their people the motivation training and tools to make it a reality they must encourage continuous dissatisfaction with the status quo while rewarding creativity leaders must also develop competencies in lean agile techniques empowered teams who can develop minimally viable products and services to test with customers to fail fast and learn from iterative attempts systems thinking focusing on how a system s parts interrelate and how that system works within larger systems design thinking idea generation and problem solving that looks at human behavior and needs in addition to business and technology factors 1leaders who commit to the lean agile approach must also commit to rethinking where they surface ideas for improvements everywhere including those for new products and services such leaders will also create an entrepreneurial work environment that extends to the edges of the company outside those that touch customers and inside those that support those who touch customers the following is what a snapshot of that environment looks like outside edge here an agile enterprise empowers frontline people who interact directly with customers including employees in customer services sales and delivery to discover unfilled customer needs for example it could be an idea for a new product or service offering or a better way to deliver that product or service inside edge this is about support functions such as hr finance legal and procurement working to improve the ways they help their customer facing colleagues this means rethinking traditional ways of working that rely on narrowly defined specialized roles predictable scope pre defined timelines budgets and staffing new thinking about improving existing systems and service will enable faster responses not only to the internal customers but will improve the organization s ability to serve external customers for example think of a traditional contracting process with fixed terms if a new type of customer service option requires a more flexible scope with few pre defined requirements adaptive procurement and legal functions will be poised to make that a reality faster than before by adopting lean agile ways of working where innovation is an everyday phenomenon the people at the outside and inside edges of an agile enterprise will be able to create and implement new ideas more rapidly yet it takes more than people and ideas it also requires lots of agile experimentation two internal tcs information systems a collaboration platform and a digital learning system are good examples our company needed to enable training and development to go beyond the classroom so that employees could be located anywhere and learn at their own pace teams working on the systems used both design thinking and agile development practices to collect and evaluate ideas and apply constraints such as information security policies scalability at the enterprise level and technical debt they used agile development methods to sharpen ideas and create prototypes they used devops to push minimally viable products into production so that end users could test them and provide feedback quickly the results fresco talk the collaboration platform grew quickly to tcs employees without an in house marketing campaign before spreading out across the company globally the digital learning platform called fresco play went through fine tuning with end users in the real world business environment before it was rolled out to employees forward looking companies are also collaborating outside of their corporate walls to harvest innovative ideas from their ecosystem partners a leading u s audio equipment manufacturer and a major toy maker are each tapping partners such as tcs to generate new product ideas through a structured ideation process the two companies then flesh out the most promising ideas and test them with business stakeholders before they enter product development cycles focused experimentationas the initiatives above show leaders must set up a system to vet incoming ideas for market relevancy and technical and financial practicality by testing and improving them with feedback from customers or customers proxies such as market experts or customer service representatives when actual end customers are not ideal evaluators for confidentiality or competitive reasons an approach we have seen work is the rapid iterative experimentation process riep see figure with riep a company sets up a system to evaluate incoming ideas by applying criteria consistent with its innovation goals it builds a portfolio of the best ideas that in light of corporate strategy and market conditions balances risk and opportunity it can perform experiments to determine which ideas are well suited for market introduction and then bring the best products and services into production the experimentation stage embodies the lean agile approach and is particularly important it is a rapid iterative process of solution prototyping concept simulation and testing to validate ideas along multiple dimensions this process will quickly and cost effectively prove or disprove critical hypotheses about an idea s customer attractiveness market viability and technical feasibility it gives internal investors for example the ceo and business unit heads the information they need to more confidently make decisions to pivot halt or continue with ideas in the portfolio figure rapid iterative experimentation processlarge companies practicing riep often start with a centralized group some call it an innovation lab or design studio or agile studio to perform the experiments in smaller firms such as startups the culture demands an all hands on deck approach where likely everyone is involved enterprise agility at workempowering people on the edges of your business to see and experiment with new concepts has been a key ingredient to the rise of some of the most successful digital companies facebook amazon and others take facebook you d be surprised by how much of the product roadmap over time is set not by us talking about what we think we should do and deciding but by engineers coming with ideas said co founder and ceo mark zuckerberg facebook stages regular hackathons in which its engineers develop initial prototypes of new products and product features these have led to some of its best offerings chat live and the platform on which developers make games hackathons have also led to its first video player 4amazon also promotes a culture of experimentation at the front lines says lean startup author eric ries i know examples where a random amazon engineer mentions hey i read about an idea in a blog post we should do that the next thing he knows the engineer is being asked to pitch it to the executive committee ceo jeff bezos decides on the spot 5when sun life financial opened its fourth innovation lab near its toronto headquarters in the year old financial services company cited its ability to bring agile teams together to meet not just with each other but also with area startups to exchange ideas the innovation labs have elevated sun life s ability to connect with customers something which alice thomas chief digital technology officer said is emblematic of the company s digital transformation it s adapting to how clients want to engage with us she said 6no time to losenow is the time to develop enterprise agility many companies face imminent threats from the changing business environment with crowdsourcing of new ideas open source technology

34,the articles in this issue of perspectives show that many c suite leaders say they believe in agile and lean approaches to making their organizations stronger and more responsive to change in the rapidly evolving digital world however how they make decisions often through a classic multi level hierarchy delegate the skills they value most in others and deal with failures from below is antithetical to making their organizations more responsive to change in other words many senior leaders have not adopted the right mindsets and behaviors to help their organizations become more agile for example a global manufacturer organized an agile work team to spearhead a million project to create a single global ordering system the goal was two fold first to balance manufacturing loads and output among plants generating supply chain efficiencies second to reduce redundancies in regional support systems the project ran into problems making one key decision how long customers would have to cancel an order stalled the project for months the team was afraid to make a wrong and consequential decision across the dozens of countries in which the company operated so it kicked the question upstairs to the executive suite after top management mulled a decision for weeks it pushed it back down and told the team to figure it out but the team was reluctant to do so work stopped and a big and important initiative presumptively using agile approaches to get its work done ground to a halt this scenario is not at all unusual among large companies that try to master lean agile approaches to implementing new digitally enabled business processes the work of the best agile teams can slow to a crawl when senior executives aren t able to change the way they lead it s one thing to train employees on agile and lean processes and tools it s another to change the way leaders make decisions and empower team leadershow leaders communicate organizational goals and how they react to success and failurethe hierarchy leaders establish to control resources and manage resultsunless leaders adopt agile mindsets to manage agile teams they can create obstacles instead of facilitating the agile approaches to developing new products services and processes that all businesses need today what it takes to change leadership mindsetschanging leadership mindsets and behaviors requires effort leaders in established companies typically have achieved their position based on their experience expertise and skills it s common for them to sit atop a pyramid style hierarchy at the top leaders are accustomed to making decisions to be carried out by those below them as they manage from above a frozen middle layer the people who work between the very top executives and the front line employees typically play it safe fearing failure these middle managers resist innovative ideas and new perspectives 1figure changing leadership styles for agile organizationslean agile approaches call for the opposite decision making style in agile teams organized around a product or issue make the decisions organizations made up of multiple agile teams are capable of quick mid course adjustments that enable the organization to sense and respond to customers and market stimuli teams experiment with solutions learn from mistakes and improve with all subsequent iterations for enterprises moving to lean agile styles of leadership individual leaders will have to bridge the gap between old styles and new this will require training coaching for the leaders who must empower teams to succeed and the leaders personal commitment to make these changes teaching successful leaders how to be agileleaders are central to building and sustaining a lean agile culture because many leaders have risen in a traditional hierarchy they will exhibit behaviors that have made them successful in the past even as the organization commits to change its way of working changing those behaviors is challenging and the reason why coaching is so important coaching begins by assessing an individual s current leadership style and how that style can work in a lean agile environment it then helps a leader adopt new behaviors new tools for engaging teams empowering them to make decisions and do their best work coaches help leaders who are accustomed to command and control top down decision making and adopting a lean agile mindset effective coaches tailor their teaching to an individual s leadership style and behaviors holding a mirror up to a leader so she can see both what she is doing and her impact on others does she instill fear or trust in team members does she possess the emotional intelligence required to take every team member s personal concerns and points of view into account as she communicates the team s priorities surveys show low employee engagement across the board gallup s survey found only a third of u s employees engaged at work this is why so called soft skills are critical coaching sessions make a leader aware of what he does now that can either enhance or inhibit the adoption of an agile culture often behaviors learned over years working and flourishing in traditional cultures don t translate to an agile environment agile organizations are flatter with lower level people authorized to make decisions for some leaders it takes practice and confidence to learn how to engage with those employees and cede to them the control they are accustomed to having coaching exercises can provide opportunities for these leaders to understand what it takes to invest the time and effort required to develop the personal relationships with team members that allow leaders to engage effectively and thereby empower team members to succeed in agile ways of working the effort to adopt an agile mindset requires building trust throughout the organization starting with leaders examples of trust include showing confidence in teams to make decisionsunderstanding failure as a learningopportunity rather than a reason to assign blamecultivating individual relationships with colleagues and appreciating their value instead of fostering a superior underling dynamic as in traditional work cultures the commitment required to changeadopting an agile leadership style first requires a program that builds awareness among both leaders and teams that the organization is changing it s important to seek buy in or informed consent from both leaders and teams that they not only agree to adopt an agile approach but they also will engage in discussions to understand why they are moving to agile and the challenges they will confront next organizations often bring in experienced teachers to guide the transition a leader going through this process can benefit from an outside perspective to help her envision what she will need to do the transition to an agile culture takes time typically more than a year to complete and it affects all aspects of the organization the third element involves learning about agile methodologies and a leader s role in supporting the teams implementing them again the differences between traditional and agile ways of working are vivid in agile approaches teams typically deliver value in small increments rather than in big chunks governance models allow for visibility into the process as team members communicate continuously about the group s activities progress and challenges and adapt based on needs that change regularly agile teams require strong backing from executive sponsors who make it possible to recruit people from across the organization as needed including a product owner from the business to lead a team ensuring it has the right number of people as well as the right tools and a working environment that will allow them to deliver the products the enterprise needs lessons from leaders at amazon and facebookcompanies like amazon and facebook which began as startups and have profited from an agile culture provide lessons about empowering teams to do their best work leaders at these organizations are doing more than removing obstacles in the way of teams trying to do great work they are leading by example to maintain amazon s startup culture amazon founder and ceo jeff bezos promotes high quality and high velocity decisions this includes recognizing and correcting poor choices quickly and adopting a strategy he calls disagree and commit supporting a team s decision if the members believe in the choice even if he doesn t for example bezos approved an amazon studios production even though he had doubts about it consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment he writes these decisions go in more than one direction amazon studios is not afraid to fail fast by canceling new shows it canceled the last tycoon two weeks after releasing a season s worth of episodes this approach embodies agile thinking to avoid complacency bezos remains obsessed with keeping his company thinking that it s always day of business facebook s flat organizational structure and acceptance of failure to improve is another example of the lean agile mindset you have to embrace organizational failure coo sheryl sandberg says this goes hand in hand with making sure top executives are not driving every decision everyone feels their input is welcomed and encouraged 5sandberg also emphasizes the role that empathy plays in leadership at facebook she says she believes in team members bringing their whole selves to work acknowledging that employees have personal lives they bring to their jobs it means we are there for each other we are flexible with what people need and then we can form the relationships that create collective resilience 6such examples show that leaders can serve their organizations best by empowering their teams and as companies like amazon and facebook demonstrate scale and growth are not obstacles to maintaining a lean agile culture agility is about peopleembracing agility is about more than technology it is about people as companies and leaders embrace agile methods it s imperative for them to invest in their people and organizational cultures not just in the technology stack or in agile development and delivery of devops to automate technical capabilities that investment is important because succeeding in creating a lean agile organization requires changing how decisions are made the way teams are formed and the way they work together embracing agility also calls for changing how organizations measure and recognize teams and leaders that means establishing incentives and rewards for teams not just individuals and it means measuring the success of leaders based on how they help others grow indeed embracing agility is about creating a more equal ecosystem rather than an organization built around departments or groups or functions that become silos agile requires every stakeholder to contribute value to the whole organization it calls for each individual to see that value and their purpose beyond any one function or department when done well the people in an agile organization see their work in a team as meaningful and their organization s work as making a positive difference for its customers and ideally the world the

35,retail ceos now have the memo yes amazon was the no online retailer in the united states in with billion in online sales almost more than in yes amazon acquired the whole foods high end healthy foods supermarket chain thus expanding its reach into brick and mortar retail for retailers confronting competition from digital first enterprises is like the proverbial drinking from the fire hose more than they can handle retail ceos also know these challenges require digital transformations that make their companies faster at innovating introducing new processes products services and marketing campaigns and they also realize it s about optimizing their store and online operations and being more adept at experimenting with new business models retail leaders also understand that their companies technology problems have become customer pain points consumers can see if a store s online prices differ from those in store if a mobile payment option isn t available or isn t working customers may go elsewhere if a personalization algorithm offers mismatched products or services customers will be disappointed in this environment it is critical to address problems as they occur and that requires them to be agile and adaptive however introducing agile approaches into their business a proven means for speeding efforts to innovate and compete is difficult but it is no longer an option realizing this several retailers worldwide are on an end to end value chain transformation to become agile digital enterprises the reluctant agilistswhile there is great enthusiasm across the retail industry for agile adoption there is also great resistance frequently from functional managers fearful of losing authority and from leaders reluctant to flatten their organizations exacerbated by an industry wide unfamiliarity with agile fundamentals we have seen some retailers attempting partial adoptions of the agile approach what we call proxy agile they do this by slicing existing projects into smaller projects hoping to gain speed the it organization s ways of working may change but the business decision makers do not these projects retain the overall scale of traditional waterfall software development projects and thus cannot respond quickly to or even collect customer feedback nor can they test and release products rapidly enough as a result they fail to help retailers make rapid innovations breaking through the barriersagile calls for sweeping changes in deep rooted ways of working it starts with leadership used to a command and control management structure and its associated behaviors the c suite has a propensity to attribute the barriers to agile to somewhere down there within the organization instead top executives need to be ready to model the following behaviors values based leadershippeople empowerment and distributed leadershiptest and learn leadershipproduct leadershippartnership and engagement among business and technology expertsagile leadership also demands empowering change agents in agile teams and providing support so they can drive transformation this work is not easy here are seven ways retail organizations can overcome the most common barriers to agile adoption espouse strong leadership commitment paying lip service to agile is not sufficient the ceo and all top level executives must be committed and engaged this commitment begins with education engaging coaches and trainers who can teach business stakeholders the principles of agile and conduct exercises to practice and inculcate its collaborative and inclusive methodology all business leaders should understand and internalize both the need for change and the essence of the agile approach they must assume product ownership including responsibility for defining the product roadmap and instituting short feedback loops to learn from and act on end user feedback create a transformation blueprint the ceo must also recruit his or her executives to work with technologists to identify how to serve customers better prioritizing initiatives that provide the most value for all stakeholders this group must create a transformation blueprint to help leaders understand what the company will look like after agile adoption how it will operate and what their roles and duties will be establish communities of practice cops the company should set up communities of practice to drive agile adoption and motivate cultural change when the agile transformation is under way the cops should provide governance for the effort and metrics to produce evidence of benefits such as improved customer satisfaction scores or faster time to market for new products and processes especially improvements in the software development lifecycle replace traditional ways of scoping projects with value driven scoping and budgeting the old ways of organizing staffing budgeting and planning projects must be replaced with value stream based funding retailers should launch high value low cost initiatives first and delegate scoping and budgeting to agile delivery teams we recommend following a quarterly cycle for portfolio demand planning discovery prioritization and funding to enable delivery based on business value adopt intelligent automation agile approaches to delivering new services won t work without embracing the automation of it systems this means adopting a machine first delivery model with devops automating the work of engineering and operations for software building testing and product introductions retailers also must invest in building capabilities for ai driven automation of engineering processes to enable fast and frequent delivery of customer products and services while reducing development overhead one of the most interesting areas of ai is seeing how the technology can be used to improve estimates ai is well placed to provide agile teams guidance on decisions in which there is a complex interplay between different variables and a lot of data available from previous projects manage organizational change project managers and application developers accustomed to the waterfall method are used to having months to plan and a year to build a new product while their bosses call the shots on features and scope the agile approach flips that with the team making those decisions and working on short projects in iterative bursts this can be disconcerting every team member should understand the organization s current state of operations as well as its competitive position why the change is necessary how it will happen and what it will take to make it successful this strategy helps ameliorate the all too human fear of change while addressing future uncertainties ongoing communications and coaching is essential a communications channel such as a mobile app can help answer any questions on the transformation journey and share information at appropriate milestones mechanisms must be set up for experience gathering and knowledge management a learning academy can offer advice instruction and support such programs will enable agile team members to work closely with agile coaches scrum masters product owners and the engineering and operations teams to design just in time interventions these interventions can be designed as experiential learning through case studies scenarios and performance aids based on an analysis of the organization s performance measure the progress organizations must develop a framework to assess the impact of changes and choose the right communication strategy for measuring progress and delivering feedback establishing a change agent network for each business area by work function and by geographic location will support the ongoing effort to drive change management associated with adopting agile providing a dashboard view for the organization is crucial to frequently assess the progress of the agile transformation journey evangelize success stories and discuss lessons learned for quick adoption of needed adjustments cruising down the agile streamagile approaches do not prescribe a standard operating model organizations must determine what specific capabilities are relevant in their customer context and experiment people process technology and operating model by using pilot projects and fine tuning their approach the best way to introduce agile techniques is to eliminate large waterfall projects immediately and replace them with work designed to be accomplished quickly when that work is tested with customers and they react positively project managers and developers begin to see the benefits of receiving immediate feedback they will warm to their task especially if their efforts are reinforced and rewarded by management although this may sound straightforward in practice it requires time patience and persistence an anecdote from our experience shows that leaders can make an important difference we recall being at an executive meeting with a retailer s functional heads who were striving to become more agile after a presentation and discussion on what an agile transformation required the head of store operations stood up to volunteer that his group be the first to adopt agile it turned out that company wanted to relaunch a new mobile application for store associates and the executive wanted to provide his staff members with capabilities to do their jobs better while stores are typically the most challenging environments in which to introduce agile this executive saw the urgency of the need to change and seized the chance the benefits of agile adoptionwhen it comes to agile adoption two major questions surface in boardrooms how can agile really help what difference does it make if our enterprise becomes fast the experiences of several leading retailers that have transformed themselves into digital first enterprises offer answers a digital first enterprise is product centric it is a technology led organization that relies on automated systems it invests in a modern architecture and takes advantage of cloud computing becoming digital first has helped several retailers create a unique and differentiated customer proposition it enables them to make intelligent decisions and quick adjustments empowered by customer feedback thus increasing their organizations resilience in the rapidly evolving retail environment in addition agile development methods have helped them adopt new business capabilities quickly like expanding their product lines offering new fulfilling methods convenient payment options and an interconnected customer experience agile methods also enable intelligent decision making these retailers have harmonized their mobile apps websites and stores to provide a seamless consistent experience for customers who switch between devices and modalities figure provides snapshot examples of what leading retailers can achieve by becoming agile retailers are using different strategies for beefing up their digital portfolios figure the benefits of being faster examples from leading retailersagile retail it all starts at the topagility at the enterprise level is about applying the principles and values of agileto create an organization level ecosystem that embraces and supports agile all the departments including support teams such as marketing sales finance and administration start espousing a by default agile mindset cultivating such a digital agile environment requires strong commitment from the leadership team they must make the transformation their top priority and define lead and communicate the transformation at the end of the transformation organizations will have a blended team of business and technology managers who are highly productive in driving on demand capability releases on a resilient technology platform that responds to any system glitch agile retailers not only serve their customers better they are better able to compete with emergent digital natives with a chance to win this makes the effort worth it recode best buy s new weapon against amazon a try before you buy

36,few stories better illustrate the challenge facing banks and financial services firms than the swift rise of quicken loans and its online rocket mortgage unit quicken loans used rocket mortgage s launch to increase its loan volume by more than to billion rocket alone closed billion in loans in its first year immediately placing it among the top u s mortgage lenders quicken loans meanwhile increased its u s mortgage market share six fold over the last years from less than to in 2how did rocket propel quicken loans the parent company s ceo credits it to embracing agile approaches in which the entire team works towards the common goal of making life radically simple for our clients through innovation and passion 3but the mortgage business is by no means the only financial services segment in which companies have adopted agile techniques to blow by competitors fintechs and startups sometimes working with established financial services firms have made real inroads in all banking products services and markets take the example of vantiv now merged with worldpay the u s based payment processor has used agile processes to become a global payments processing leader in countries handling trillion in transactions per year 4agile adopters such as online only u s banks like movenbank and allybank boast about offering competitive financial products and a better customer experience than many of their brick and mortar brethren online wealth management firms like iquantifi are using robo advisers and algorithms to provide financial advice to clients digital mortgage lending platform provider roostify has partnered with jpmorgan chase to let home buyers track loan applications online 6mobile payment platforms also represent a threat to the banking and financial services industry alipay the digital wallet operated by alibaba offshoot ant financial boasts million chinese customers representing of china s trillion internet payment market and the company is expanding outside china its rival wechat pay linked to the wechat message service offered by tencent accounted for of that market in and has moved into malaysia both services mobile payment volumes dwarf totals logged in the u s mobile payments also have driven growth at paypal whose latest quarterly profit rose rise in its most recent quarterly report powered in part by venmo the company s social payment platform and by partnerships with big banks like jpmorgan chase as well as tech titans like google apple and facebook 10those digital first giants provide their own challenges as researchers expect apple facebook and google to drive growth in payments through their customers smartphones11 mobile devices have given consumers powerful tools for conducting a universe of financial transactions and they expect their banks like their stores and governments to work anytime anywhere like their favorite apps while banking leaders understand the need to adopt agile approaches to counter such disruptive competition their existing processes systems and organizational structures stand in the way of adoption even some with agile teams still take months to do what nimbler competitors do in days or weeks banks and financial institutions that wish to compete with truly agile organizations all face the same question can we become agile enough fast enough the missing link unprecedented cross functional collaborationexecutives at large banks and financial services companies run into familiar problems trying to deploy agile teams and scaling agile across the enterprise while each institution takes an approach best suited to its context the lack of a common vision why agile and what it means to adopt the agile way of working leads to many failing to deliver the business value they anticipated these institutions run multiple lines of business with organizational structures and processes to support each one but these structures and processes typically create distance between marketing research legal and other participants in agile teams instead of collaboration there are hand offs the marketing team hands off a decision to the finance team and the finance team adds information and hands the decision off to the it team to develop a solution this adds time and static to the development and launch of new financial products the it landscape at big banks is another major barrier to agility over time through mergers acquisitions and other changes their systems have become complex and unwieldy implementing a simple feature in a customer engagement system for example requires difficult integration work and iterative testing to make sure the new feature works well with other features and doesn t break them in addition there typically is little automation available to test and release software in this environment agile teams inevitably confront bottlenecks and grow frustrated these problems share a common theme business and it managers must work continuously together to bring new products from conception to market if they don t agile methodologies will never achieve the speed for which they were created agile won t work without a unity of purpose a one team approach in short becoming an agile organization calls for a transformation that engages people systems and processes at all levels agile is not just about creating software coming together around agileto overcome the impediments to becoming agile financial services companies must take three paths organizational assessment and planning they need to define their vision identify the internal impediments to agility and create an enterprise transformation roadmap to overcome them this is about having a change management strategy adequately supported with resources any systemic change requires a feedback mechanism to collect and analyze stakeholder reactions addressing the feedback is what drives progress implementation preparations the goal of agile transformation is to create customer value quickly therefore companies should establish teams organized around discrete pieces of the customer experience those teams will work best when managers demonstrate servant leadership i e acting frequently to remove impediments that can slow the work of digital product teams rather than operating in a traditional command and control mode technology platform and engineering culture to support the agile deployment of new products financial services firms need to employ modern it architectures and designs like micro services and application programming interfaces apis that take advantage of the latest technology infrastructure designs and cloud based systems what s more product engineers must adopt a culture of automated systems converting manual technology work into automated work wherever possible empowered teams are at the center of the actionself organizing teams staffed with people from all relevant functions are the heart of an agile organization they not their superiors must be allowed to decide what they can deliver in weeks not months based on the resources they have these teams have the power to make these decisions because they are backed by the business s leaders that only happens when everyone in the c suite understands and visibly demonstrates through daily attendance at team meetings if need be that agile adoption is necessary to the organization s future why do all cxos need to be on board because only they can give teams the flexibility to define the scope of their work and prioritize goals based on the business value their products deliver to customers banks succeed with agile adoption when they have business it teams in which members share ownership of the work the delivery of new functions to customers a company s technology foundation also is critical to optimizing agile teams leading practitioners of agile methodologies adopt devops strategies that automatically release new features after the team develops them devops empowers a company to collect timely feedback from customers about new digital products that feedback enables teams to quickly improve the product the customer experience or both building the team how to do it rightagile teams must possess all the required skills for assessing customer needs and developing new products and product features as such team members must include representatives from all functions that impact the customer experience i e marketing sales finance hr it research operations and other groups four other principles are crucial to the success of these agile teams organizing teams by features any team should focus on customer journeys mapping and improving a consumer s experience at every step of his or her interaction with the bank for example a team could work to make the loan origination process more efficient team members would examine every step in the workflow from routing documents to how consumers upload them online to ensure requirements consumer credit histories loan eligibility bank account validation employment and property value check are met as seamlessly and effortlessly as possible we have seen agile teams cut days from this process by eliminating activities that don t add value for example in the mortgage lending process customers can provide electronic signatures for documents instead of coming into the bank a move that saves time and reduces mistakes electronic systems to check an applicant s credit history and other changes have trimmed six or seven days from the loan approval process meeting customers desires for a faster easier to use process develop team skills for analyzing and improving customer value streams team members must be able to dissect what information and expertise are necessary to improve key customer processes that requires cross functional teams that can ask questions such as what are the key elements and business processes central to the bank s operations how many handoffs are happening between systems and functions what tasks add value and don t and thus could be eliminated mapping a customer process such as from inquiry to cash will shine a light on ways to improve workflows and eliminate waste however the team working on that process must be composed of members from all the functions that impact that process scale those agile skills banks that want to adopt agile approaches are wise to start small even with one team before going big however once a bank makes one agile team successful the goal should be to create many more agile teams across the organization that will help it to build a culture of rapid iterative and customer responsive change when that happens banks will have a flatter organization in which middle managers can move from a command and control mindset to servant leadership assisting teams instead of running them all this requires extensive training and coaching by agile experts team members must master agile approaches as well as their roles on the team managers must be trained how to shift their style from supervising subordinates to empowering them work areas need more open spaces and flexible seating arrangements they will foster greater collaboration and improve team productivity while also appealing to millennial team members tools that help team members collaborate especially chat applications document repositories and project management software are also instrumental to boosting team productivity figure banking features ripe for reuse4 build once use many times when a team develops a hit feature for customers the organization should look for other parts of the business that could reuse it this principle is especially relevant to banking and financial services figure shows common examples that we ve seen of banking features that agile teams are repurposing in their companies how agile can pay offbanks with agile cultures introduce new products and services much faster they also are quicker at identifying and making cost reductions customer ratings also improve the impact can be eye opening a u s based financial services company cut the time it took to introduce new features and the time to test them the cost of product development fell a leading u s mortgage banking services provider reduced the time it took to roll out new product features by as much as from an average months to weeks what s more the percent of customers who used the new features jumped from to not surprisingly the company s jd power customer survey ratings rose a large global bank deploying a digital channel for consumers who wanted a mobile first experience cut the cost of customer research by after adopting agile approaches it also reduced the time it took to execute payments by and the average time it took customers to open a new brokerage account by success takes work making agile change stickeven as financial services company executives recognize the need to adopt agile approaches generating benefits like those described above won t be easy three challenges routinely emerge winning over key business stakeholders organizing geographically dispersed teams and embracing an agile culture across the enterprise however each challenge can be overcome collaboration with business stakeholders while bringing business and it people together in agile teams is vital to their success at some banks decision makers see both the company s problems and solutions as belonging to it even when technology is central to addressing an issue however agile efforts will fail without participation from business functions success with agile requires cross functional collaboration and direct participation teams should include a role for a business side participant who serves as team leader or product owner team meetings should be frequent with regular presentations and product demonstrations to business leaders teams must also convince business leaders they must devote time to the effort distributed teams when a group of software developers created the agile manifesto in they emphasized the value of face to face conversation in today s business environment with teams often spread across the globe that s not always possible managing this challenge demands emphasizing the close communication required among all team members teams can still collaborate over long distances when they skillfully distribute work tasks they can even hasten progress this still requires regular meetings and leveraging collaboration tools it also involves the extensive use of what s referred to as information radiators large charts physical or digital to track team member tasks and to communicate and sustain team momentum this information must be available to all team members whether or not they work in the same room embracing an agile culture culture change is hard many managers loath ceding control to get them to embrace agile its value must be demonstrated to them for example a team can show metrics such as data on customer reactions to minimum viable products mvps and subsequent customer feedback on the iterative improvements to those products skills development is another element of an agile culture banks should cross train team members so they gain additional skills that will reduce the number of handoffs to other teams which will increase productivity we have seen banks train business analysts to perform quality function tasks such as working on test specifications in addition to product specifications and developers pick up testing skills and vice versa by working together team members can also gain t shaped skills by this we mean they bring knowledge and experience in a particular area the vertical bar of the t and leverage knowledge gained from working with experts in other areas top of the t agile methodologies embrace fast failures flaws in a product or service idea that a team discovers early and then fixes this makes it possible to show how the early lessons learned from such failures can save time and money later as compared to traditional approaches there are likely to be some in the organization who resist the effort to move to agile to bring detractors on board leaders can implement a comprehensive change management strategy building awareness cultivating participants acceptance and enabling them to understand the benefits what s in it for me demonstrating quick results from the effort will help win over colleagues who are skeptical of agile the message needs to be this the company s competitiveness depends on it once these barriers are overcome it should become obvious that the adoption of agile is making the organization stronger agile should be breaking down barriers across the organization and focusing it on what matters most to customers and not on products or product features that aren t generating value and combined with devops practices that automate the release of new technology enabled features agile can bring more coherence to a bank s effort to develop it systems that were not integrated from past mergers and acquisitions leaders at banks and financial services companies know that innovative fintechs are working hard to take their business and they are agile for a reason agile approaches are critical to making established financial services firms grow faster become more

37,when the signatories of the agile manifesto spelled out a new way to develop software in the sixth of their guiding principles was having agile team members work in the same room the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face to face conversation the authors said 1but years later this is not only impractical for many initiatives it has become a big liability letting agile team members work from different locations is now a must and it is one that a growing number of companies are proving to be both paramount and possible what other companies have found is that having agile team members operate from different sites gives them three advantages in digital transformation skills knowledge and speed in this article i will explain why location independent agile teams can beat agile teams whose members occupy the same room and thus why companies must be prepared to make their agile initiatives location independent ignoring the 6th principle most agile teams are already location independentit s not hard to see why the authors of the agile manifesto urged companies to create agile teams that work in the same room the ability to have face to face conversations on demand can increase trust accelerate decisions and spawn better ideas it s a key reason why online music company spotify has grown from zero to billion in annual revenue since it launched its streaming service in and alone between and with more than million subscribers today to its streaming music services spotify whose legal headquarters is luxembourg divides its agile teams into four types squads tribes guilds and chapters each squad works out of the same room with one room devoted to each squad a squad typically consists of six to seven people who produce the code that s put into use often daily on the firm s site for music listeners and music sellers rapidly growing born digital companies like spotify are held out as agile exemplars as two forrester research analysts amanda leclair and jeffrey s hammond stated in a report co locating software development teams is the ideal we certainly understand the sentiment but it s outlived its usefulness as most organizations that use agile methods are now saying despite the benefits of co located teams several studies have found that the clear majority of those organizations are using remote members in their agile teams according to forrester only of agile development shops at large companies have co located teams the survey was based on respondents 4a ventureone survey of people at mostly north american and european organizations found had agile teams whose members worked at multiple locations the company s survey on agile practices found more than twice as many had location independent agile teams compared with the number three years earlier scott ambler + associates survey found of companies had agile team members who worked offsite 6in our work at global companies we have observed hundreds of successful location independent agile projects one such company is abn amro with five million retail customers its retail banking business is one of the top three in the netherlands from to this day the bank has progressively embraced agile approaches to developing new digital banking services since then the time it takes to test and build new digital offerings has been reduced by abn amro has also cut by the time it takes to shift new digital services or service updates from production into the marketplace from to two weeks our agile way of working now facilitates the quick implementation of ideas said abn amro ceo kees van dijkhuizen in the bank s annual report 8that s crucial given all the new digital competition for consumers banking business digitalization and changing client behavior is moving far faster than we reckoned said van dijkhuizen one of the bank s many digital innovations is a smartphone app called tikkie it allows customers to send payments to family or friends through text messages by january more than two million abn amro customers were using tikkie double the number just six months earlier 9since a u s insurance company has dispersed of its previously co located agile teams to location independent teams operating in three geographies those teams include software developers in offshore locations on the other side of the world three reasons for location independent agileso why are most companies ignoring the agile manifesto s sixth principle we believe it comes down to three reasons they must tap important but rare skills from afar agile teams require skills from multiple disciplines these days software development business processes data science and more and of course each team needs someone well versed in agile for example spotify s squads each have an agile coach many of these skills are in huge demand and short supply companies located in areas in which software development and analytics skills are not abundant must bring those people on their agile teams in many cases that will mean tapping into them from afar yet some companies still tap skills from afar even when they are locally abundant consider the immensely popular blog site wordpress which generates million unique monthly viewers in the u s alone its parent company automattic is based in san francisco yet nearly all its employees work from their homes in countries they need essential knowledge that doesn t exist locally while it s not easy to separate knowledge from skills i consider skills to be the capability a person gains from doing something many times knowledge on the other hand is possessing information on a topic those with the most information on it become experts that others go to for advice for example i can become highly knowledgeable about the sport of soccer as many sportswriters are but never become highly skilled at playing the game as many sportswriters are as well in the context of agile many teams need to tap the brains of experts not just the skills of other team members this expertise could be about the messages on an important new user screen i e is it clear and compelling or it could be about deep customer insights that only someone in your firm s market research department possesses i e the person who conducted the research or it could be some other knowledge i e knowledge from people with rare expertise and who don t have the hours to commit full time to any agile team while you may not need this knowledge every day on an agile team you might need to draw on it frequently and if you want to draw on it frequently you are very likely to need these people to share their expertise via web meetings or conference calls they need to make rapid decisions and not force people to travel to make them if you accept the need to have skills and knowledge of professionals from other locales on your agile teams then you must also accept the fact that you can t wait for these people to travel to the location of your core agile team before you can make key decisions that adds days or even longer to your schedule this will especially be the case if you re drawing on knowledge experts from outside your company i e people whose expertise is in such high demand that they don t need to travel anywhere to impart it mastering agile demands teams that are self organized and disciplined with a razor sharp focus on goals and daily progress thus the preference for having team members in one place to facilitate collaboration attempts to assemble a team in one location however can run into problems it may be costly to move people even temporarily to co locate them and not everyone will agree to it leaders are likely to face resistance if they try to force people with domain knowledge from the business side marketing finance hr etc to relocate to wherever the agile team members work furthermore a large organization may have hundreds of agile teams and not enough business experts to assign to all of them agile projects in many companies have grown in size and territory across offices states countries time zones and even continents many large enterprises have skilled professionals in various disciplines all over the world collaborating to develop online business processes and the underlying systems mastering agile demands teams that are self organized and disciplined with a razor sharp focus on goals and daily progress thus the preference for having team members in one place to facilitate collaboration attempts to assemble a team in one location however can run into problems it may be costly to move people even temporarily to co locate them and not everyone will agree to it leaders are likely to face resistance if they try to force people with domain knowledge from the business side marketing finance hr etc to relocate to wherever the agile team members work furthermore a large organization may have hundreds of agile teams and not enough business experts to assign to all of them agile projects in many companies have grown in size and territory across offices states countries time zones and even continents many large enterprises have skilled professionals in various disciplines all over the world collaborating to develop online business processes and the underlying systems mastering agile demands teams that are self organized and disciplined with a razor sharp focus on goals and daily progress making the location independent team click four new agile principlesat the risk of sounding like i m writing my own agile manifesto trust me i am not i do want to offer some new agile principles for companies that want their location independent teams to thrive these are messages for the leaders of an organization who can play a highly influential role in setting the rules for how globally dispersed eclectically skilled and ethnically and culturally diverse people need to work together ensure intellectual harmony make sure at the outset that all agile team members understand each other s domains and terminology to achieve a common understanding of the terms and manners in which they must work together promote role equality ensure unwavering respect for everyone s expertise i e no caste system protect strongly fiercely protect the dispersed agile team from the internal corporate attackers especially when the investments mount and the returns are still in the future convert widely convince skeptical executives to become agile advocates i e why this approach is essential to their and the organization s success locating all agile team members in the same room has become a well intended but quaint myth instead companies must create location independent agile teams groups working on the same effort not located in the same place in this way enterprises can tap the talent needed to innovate and remain competitive wherever it resides in the world generating more and better ideas for improving digital processes or products the biggest reason why most companies are ignoring the sixth principle of the agile manifesto is that it no longer makes business sense leaders who understand the severe limitations of forcing people with the skills and knowledge to be in the same room day in and day out are making location independent agile teams work and work well agile manifesto

38,artificial intelligence ai machine learning and related technologies were once the realm of science fiction fueled by affordable computing power and ample supplies of data these technologies now have reached the point where they can evaluate options make decisions and even take action to execute those decisions the opportunities are abundant technological improvements in data processing and sensors coupled with better statistical models and algorithms have driven recent advances in ai sensors nowadays are approaching near human capabilities when it comes to image processing voice and accent recognition and sentiment analysis ai systems today can correlate events recognize patterns and derive meaning from the data the combined power of these innovations has produced breakthroughs like driverless cars established automakers and industry newcomers such as google uber and tesla are pouring billions of dollars into creating autonomous vehicles toyota alone will invest billion from to to introduce ai into its cars and robots in its factories 1but interest in ai extends far beyond the automotive sector by that year the companies surveyed expect that nearly half of the ai investments would be used for transformative change rather than incremental operational improvements the tcs global trend study2 of more than large companies across north america europe asia pacific and latin america found that companies are using ai already and see the technology as important to staying competitive in the year 3companies noticing these innovations are keen to find ways to bring automation to functions ranging from customer service to risk management to hr consumers who already benefit from ai through the social media sites they use car ride services and other smartphone apps represent another source of big demand figure ai imitates human action to mimic human intelligencesome companies have already generated big benefits from their ai initiatives a global information services and publishing company used machine learning to dramatically improve its customers ability to derive insights from thousands of legal documents they processed a leading communication service provider has piloted an ai program to improve its network uptime by deploying a cognitive intelligent platform that combined machine learning analytics and robotic automation to predict and prevent network failures but even with such ai and automation success stories most companies we know are not quite sure where to focus their ai investments as a result they proceed cautiously while a distinct minority rushes forward in the average annual ai investment among companies surveyed in our trend report was million but the median spend was only million most companies were using ai to improve their it operations especially with the aim of detecting and deterring attempted intrusions into their computer networks and data centers significantly smaller percentages of the companies surveyed reported applying ai to their customer service sales and marketing functions looking to the future of the executives expect that by ai will have the greatest competitive impact outside of it in functions such as sales marketing customer service and hr our experience shows these executives are not only correct but that companies in a variety of industries see gains today along a continuum as shown in figure market research firms are capitalizing on ai s image recognition capabilities by using it to collect market data data providers use ai to analyze legal documents and identify potential problems telecommunications companies apply ai to diagnose network problems cpg companies use ai to predict and prevent fraudulent invoices and retailers use ai powered chatbots to assist customers on internet a major airline provides another example in this industry on time performance is a key customer experience indicator and flight delays are a huge concern while an airline cannot control the weather reducing the impact of delays and proactively communicating with customers can make a difference for example faster insights into upcoming delays can enable an airline to execute more precise schedules for airport gates ground crews flight crews and other personnel one major airline used advanced machine learning techniques to build two predictive models one for flight departure delays and a second for arrival delays to anticipate whether a flight departing later in the day would take longer than scheduled the resulting analysis led to a more precise understanding of the reasons internal and external for flight delays and the impact of delays on the flight network the airline was able to improve operational efficiency by adjusting staffing and other resources for anticipated schedule changes thereby strengthening brand perception figure shows that as ai increases in complexity and capability it goes from imitating human action to mimicking human intelligence as the list of examples grows and as companies experimenting with ai gain experience the question for both newcomers remains where should we begin three ai traps to avoidbefore prioritizing their ai investments executives should be wary about falling into three common traps the deep pockets trap in most companies the it department spends the maximum possible on technology it departments can make a solid case for using ai to protect data centers and networks but just because it has the biggest technology budget that doesn t mean that it necessarily deserves the lion s share of ai investments in fact a company might be able to get a greater roi from targeted ai investments in finance and procurement functions to cut down on fraudulent customer transactions the robot trap beware the lure of shiny objects robots that can clean hotel rooms or answer questions at the front desk are alluring because they have a tangible physical presence an ai powered tool that flags potentially fraudulent customer purchases may not have the same glamour as a robot but it might have a much bigger benefit to a company s bottom line the pure insights trap it s important to remember that ai is just a tool ai applied to research and analysis can yield all sorts of insights but executives should make sure that ai powered research is focused on insights that are useful and applicable to the company s goals and needs connect ai to business value pinpointing your company s greatest ai opportunitiesdespite ai s potential to transform products and business processes executives must not get caught up in the hype before they fund ai projects they need to carefully consider where they can most likely get the greatest positive impact from ai in the organization in the c suite each function head brings a point of view to the question chief operating officers typically look to trim costs most sales executives we know salivate over using ai to identify the best prospects and win the sale many corporate strategists view ai as a way to better understand the changing landscape of competitive moves and customer needs the key is to recognize failures quickly cut your losses learn from those failures and make changes to improve the chances of success on future ai projects starting out with ai means developing a sharp focus for most companies ai projects will not resemble the multi year billion dollar moon shots like the creation of a driverless car in the auto industry instead c suite executives should prioritize and fund agile short term to months projects backed by a strong business case some failures are inevitable when projects do succeed companies can expand on those successes by pursuing additional related opportunities figure shows that enterprises typically start with six sigma lean and task based automation and then move towards more advanced stages based on ai figure maturity journey of an intelligent enterprisea three step approach to evaluating automation and ai opportunities can clarify an organization s best ai opportunities isolate functions that require human intervention any task a human currently performs such as data entry or invoice processing could theoretically be automated or performed by a system with ai capabilities for example a market research firm implemented a system that used machine learning image recognition and cognitive intelligence to interpret product images and automatically capture product attributes to help its consumer packaged goods customers track the competitive marketplace instead of having people research and check the images and status of goods for sale an ai enabled system automated the process saving considerable time and cost remove from consideration during the pilot stage those functions that would be too costly to automate now for example if a telecommunications provider was exploring its first ai project it would more likely look to an area like reducing customer churn or improving arpu average revenue per user with proven results in the short term rather than a multi year program automate functions with the greatest roi potential companies should look to automate functions that require extensive amounts of manual labor i e an ai system that analyzes insurance claims data and authorizes payments or a credit card company s chatbot that communicates online with customers and sends out a replacement card to those who lose their cards companies in practically any industry could deploy hr chatbots to answer customer inquiries or collect data from job applicants saving staff time to schedule final interviews the experience of a leading market research organization shows the benefits of a targeted approach the company used advanced machine learning to automate the process of tracking consumer packaged goods to analyze their performance the process uses a master product reference repository with a set of defined characteristics in multiple consumer product categories because of the volume and complexity of the data involved there are more than items that enter the market in a given month it can take more than two weeks to code product entries for a few regions the company deployed advanced machine learning technology that automated multiple aspects of the process including comparing existing and new products predicting prices of goods for sale and analyzing the text used to define the products the system deployed an image recognition algorithm adapted to mimic the way the human brain interprets images on product labels the system which automates the capture of product metadata yields faster insights with fewer human interventions so marketers can respond to market trends more quickly at a lower cost of operations how to evaluate potential ai and automation investmentsthis process of maximizing benefits from ai projects starts by taking a holistic overview of the company s strategic priorities and pain points consider the competitive landscape and determine where ai or automation can bring the company closer to attaining its strategic priorities for instance will ai and automation help the company accelerate time to market for its new products and services similarly companies should determine which pain points such as inefficient supply chains or poor after sales service stand in the way of high performance companies need to diagnose the root causes of those problems and should be able to identify which parts of their operations need improvement figure technical complexity of ai implementation and potential benefitsas companies identify improvement areas they can consider which ones lend themselves to automation and digitization are the processes predictable and repeatable is the it environment stable or shifting if the company is in the midst of a multi stage it transformation it can be very complex to attempt to insert automation or ai technology into that precarious context of course companies should perform a cost benefit analysis before embarking on any ai or automation project based on our experiences of helping companies implement such projects we know that roi typically requires balancing expected benefits against the technical complexities of implementation as shown in figure to calculate the business benefits of an ai or automation program companies should consider how many human transactions the new system will replace and the average time it takes to complete a process on the cost side companies must consider the upfront investment of implementing an ai program maintenance costs and whether automation will deliver lower costs per transaction or such other savings the more judgment required the higher order the ai capabilities must be for instance a life sciences company trying to automate the process of reviewing reports from doctors evaluating a drug going through clinical trials would need a deep understanding of the industry figure shows that companies should assess automation projects based on both their technical complexity and potential business benefits pulling the right lever at the right timeafter identifying promising opportunities to deploy ai or automation technologies corporate leaders still need to figure out which technology to pursue artificial intelligence represents the highest level of business automation true ai can sense think and act this type of ai is necessary to power self driving cars in complex unpredictable environments a medical robot might use ai to analyze human vital signs and give advice to doctors about diagnosis and possible treatments cognitive computing systems also can sense and think in a corporate context such capabilities can enable people to do their jobs better improve business processes and increase profitability cognitive computing systems might automate actions people once performed or give people suggestions about their next action such systems typically have natural language processing capabilities to collect and analyze large amounts of text documents and other forms of unstructured data for instance a life sciences company could use such a system to scan records of millions of clinical cases involving its products detect adverse events and report them to regulators cognitive computing systems generally have machine learning elements that apply algorithms to find patterns in data for instance a marketing firm could analyze the consumption patterns of its many consumers the predictive analytics elements of cognitive computing systems allow companies to analyze data from business processes and find recommended ways to improve results for example the system might review a company s existing process of delivering orders and then provide recommendations on getting customers their products faster and with fewer errors robotic process automation gives companies a way to apply automation on smaller projects chatbots are still new but they already can respond to customer queries about simple billing questions similarly virtual private assistants make it easier for employees at professional services firms to make travel plans assess your situation then moveai and automation are top of mind technologies companies around the globe are eager to take advantage of them executives at a leading communication service provider were no different when they approached an opportunity to improve the uptime of their network providing superior connectivity depends on efficient functioning of telecom networks the industry relies on manual identification and resolution of network incidents caused by technical or environmental problems or human error it is a time consuming and inefficient process this service provider sought to improve network uptime and reduce costs while saving time and strengthening service the project included four sequential phases by deploying a cognitive intelligent platform that dynamically combined machine learning analytics and robotic automation for network failure prediction the company was able to automate portions of the network maintenance process like the service provider s experience shows incorporating ai into a company s operations is a tailored fit evaluating these opportunities requires a careful and candid assessment of a company s competitive landscape its digital maturity the effectiveness of existing business practices versus industry benchmarks the potential for improvement and the complexity of the technological context into which ai and automation would be inserted to get the most out of ai and automation companies need to combine the right automation technology to the right situation at the right time this process takes time but there s no time to wait1 the new york times toyota invests

39,it s become increasingly conceivable and cost effective to embed sensors wireless communication and software into all kinds of products from complex industrial machines to thermostats sold on the mass market exponential improvements in computing power advances in sensor miniaturization and pervasive connectivity have paved the way it s a transformation described by harvard business school professor michael e porter and james heppelmann ceo of software company ptc as a move from goods that are simply composed of mechanical and electrical parts to the complex systems we now know as smart connected products 1b2b manufacturers of high cost assets have led the way in this revolution turning their products into services or servitizing them with significant results schindler no longer simply produces elevators capable of transporting passengers up and down reliably the company s technology can analyze and predict elevator demand patterns to reduce elevator wait times by as much as ge has long sold jet engines locomotives gas fired turbines and medical imaging equipment today it sells smart connected versions of the same equipment along with new services built upon the vast amounts of data they generate the result is a business model that not only sells jet engines for example but a full spectrum of performance enhancements across the management of a flight farm and construction equipment maker caterpillar has more than connected assets in service from autonomous mining trucks to tug boats 4the business value of connecting expensive assets like jet engines and mining equipment machines that can cost companies millions in revenues if they are out of service or run inefficiently to the internet of things is clear but embedding sensors and connectivity into lower value consumer products can deliver significant benefits as well a number of brands have already introduced smart connected versions of everyday goods from home printers that can order their own ink before they run out to refrigerators that can order more milk the smart home space is abuzz with developments in automation and control even a product as seemingly simple as a toothbrush is getting the smart connected treatment procter gamble s oral b genius pairs a position detection sensor in the brush with a mobile app to help users identify spots they re missing with their oral hygiene approaches as of february p g said it had sold more than million oral b smartseries toothbrushes worldwide yet it called the product merely the tip of the iceberg 6successful manufacturers of smart connected products adopt new technologies including sensors connectivity and personalization technologies and smart materials they must innovate not just around products but also with their business models to create a lean efficient and cost effective ecosystem that runs from the supply chain through to customers from whom they receive real time data and insights on product usage through these actions manufacturers can translate insights from data into profitable business models for today s data economy this is a major paradigm shift in the past products were sold as capital equipment churning huge revenues in the data economy the aim for manufacturers is to build a revenue stream by selling more services to match the rapid pace of change in their customers preferences manufacturers also have to be ready to run their business models like a social network distributed yet connected real time and with a non linear propagation they also have technological and operational capabilities to support these ongoing changes in products data management and services still many consumer and b2b companies have yet to begin making their products smart and connected only about a quarter of the large companies we surveyed around the globe in said they had made a smart connected product what s more they estimate they devoted less than a third of their internet of things budgets to smart product monitoring but companies will very soon pay a competitive price for sitting on the sidelines in the smart connected product space the cost of iot sensors is rapidly declining from in to a predicted in bandwidth processing and storage costs have also declined several tenfolds over the last decade the analytics systems required to make sense of the data produced by smart connected devices are also becoming more advanced as these trends continue sensor technology will become ubiquitous gartner forecasts that billion connected things will be in use worldwide in reaching billion by the boston consulting group predicts that companies will spend billion on iot technologies products and services in 9nearly every manufacturer today should be exploring making their products smart and connected not simply because the cost of doing so is dropping dramatically but because there are increasingly clear benefits to doing so and the stakes for failing to ask the question could mean the difference between future success and failure seven business benefits of smart connected productswhen a product whether a automobile or a electric toothbrush is smart it has sensors processors and software embedded in them that can track key aspects of their performance fuel performance or toothbrushing execution and when that product is connected it can wirelessly transmit the data it collected when companies are able to continuously analyze the data streaming from these products it opens up a world of potential business value and competitive advantage it creates the unprecedented ability to monitor products at the most important stage of their lifecycle when they are in the customer s hands that provides an unambiguous new source of business intelligence in a wide variety of areas from product performance to customer experience smart connected capabilities are already enabling manufacturers of both high and low end products to reimagine not just their products but also their business models when companies are able to continuously analyze the data streaming from these products it opens up a world of potential business value and competitive advantage while the business value of a smart connected product will vary by industry market factors and customer needs we have identified benefits that await businesses which embrace them faster more effective product updates and development because manufacturers can continuously monitor products in use they can update their products patch problems and rethink functionality all of which improves customer satisfaction the intelligence from smart connected products can also inform future product features and new product development we are all familiar with automatic app updates on our phones giving us access to new features or fixing problems over the air smart connected products can update themselves in the same way diebold for example can update and add new features to its smart connected atms remotely via software fitbit has been able to increase its new product development thanks to the information it has on how customers use the fitness band and those new offerings can come in the form of either hardware or software options 11cheaper more efficient maintenance and repair because smart connected products can be monitored in the field that data can be used to significantly streamline the process of maintenance and repair rolls royce tracks the health of thousands of aircraft engines operating worldwide using onboard sensors and live satellite feeds its engine health management system can predict when something might go wrong to address it proactively or transmit data on an engine problem so airlines can have their service technicians ready with the right part to make repairs when it lands resulting in less downtime 12new better business models many industrial manufacturers are remaking themselves as service providers by creating new business lines based on the analysis of smart product data ge digital for example launched its brilliant manufacturing software and service using real time visibility into smart connected machines to help customers maintain equipment based on operating conditions rather than a breakdown thus driving greater efficiency in fact some companies may see a benefit in shifting their business models from selling goods to renting products and offering services michelin for example has gone to market with a smart connected tire that is a product service hybrid fleet customers sign up for their customized tire lease programs and pay by the mile for their usage while michelin oversees any maintenance or repair 14the data that manufacturers gather from their smart connected products may also have value to other companies or organizations that would pay for it for example analysis of p g s oral b genius data could be sold to retailers or dentists who could use that intelligence to better run their own businesses or consider the opportunity that an automaker has to send useful information to motorists through an in car infotainment system such as the location of a parking lot or a nearby event the automaker becomes a medium through which other businesses communicate to prospective customers improved product usage a smart connected product can provide intelligence and guidance to customers to help them make better use of it or engage more deeply with the brand progressive insurance which has a usage based auto insurance product built upon in car telematics sensors and monitoring is one example it launched a mobile app for customers that at the end of each trip gives drivers personalized information including a one to five star rating a data summary a map of their drive and tailored driving tips to help them improve their score 15better product recall processes poorly handled product defects and hazards can be enormously expensive to brands not only in direct costs but reputational damage as evidenced by incidents such as takata s giant and expanding airbag recall which drove it to bankruptcy16 and samsung s galaxy note recall which cost the company billion with sensing connectivity and the ability to detect a customer s product problems manufacturers can uncover dangerous defects more quickly and provide fixes more effectively when the national highway traffic safety administration announced that a tesla motors charger plug had been discovered to cause fires tesla owners didn t have to do anything the company provided an over the air software update to fix it 18reduced environmental impact manufacturers of smart connected products can retain more control over what happens to a product not only during the lifecycle of its first purchase but how it might be reused or recycled to reduce its negative environmental impact companies that can track individual products can better ensure its parts are recycled correctly or even reused in entirely new ways rather than being dumped in landfills some visionary manufacturers are adopting a product as a service approach that ensures that this is the case for instance if a telecom company provides handsets or smartphones as a part of its service contracts it may collect refurbish and reuse them in areas where there is an economic need to provide less expensive options with a lifetime of performance data manufacturers can also offer reconditioned products with warranties similar to new options more intelligent adaptive supply chains industrial equipment manufacturers can deploy digital twins d virtual reality replicas of their physical products to help them model manufacturing flows and figure out how to eliminate bottlenecks or adapt to changes as data streams in the digital stand in shows how the product reacts to various conditions it then demonstrates how it can be used to provide new insights into how products can be better designed manufactured operated and serviced according to porter and heppelmann 19ultimately manufacturers can embrace not just connected but cognitive supply chains to enable automated just in time or just in sequence manufacturing how to evaluate your smart connected opportunityit s becoming clear that for most manufacturers it should no longer be a question of if they make their products smart and connected but when those that wait too long to adapt to this new reality will get left behind still manufacturers must be prudent in their approach in this arena efforts to develop smart connected products for the sake of doing so without a clear understanding of transformation requirements and business value are bound to fail while the barrier to entry in the smart connected product world is low and getting lower by the day companies must be thoughtful about what they will do with the data these intelligent products will collect figure gives some examples of issues to consider figure smart products factors to considerproduct and service differentiation companies should begin evaluating their opportunities for connected products by figuring out whether this approach would create any significant differentiation in the product category will it make their product more attractive to purchase could it inform better product development later on boeing s which has now been in service for six years generates more data every day than the rest of the company s fleet does in their lifetimes that has helped the aircraft manufacturer not only improve the performance of the boeing to the benefit of its customers it has also informed the development of the company s latest model the boeing max 20quantifying customer value manufacturers should also think about what kind of value and how much making a product smart and connected would generate for customers the interaction customers have with a product can help determine the right approach high involvement products such as vehicles or smartphones typically have many features and thus customers can benefit greatly from the guidance provided by a smart connected version low involvement products like computer printers or coffee machines tend to have much less functionality but may still benefit from sensors and connectivity that relieve customers of burdens like reordering supplies or maintenance existing product usage patterns companies should also think about how companies use a product before developing a smart connected plan for it high utility products like a fitness tracker will provide many more data points than a smart toothbrush thus the data may have more or wider value in the broader business ecosystem your data management capabilities finally manufacturers must ensure that they are prepared to manage the explosion of digital data that smart connected products will produce they will need to set up the appropriate cloud infrastructure to manage these huge and growing volumes of product data they will also have to invest in product specific analytic capabilities and processes to generate insight based on the data and they will need to rethink their processes to integrate that insight and act on it next stepsin the digital era where customer experience is the competitive differentiator and creating sustainable competitive advantage is a top priority making products smart and connected will make sense for most manufacturers an intelligent approach for manufacturers that want to pursue this opportunity calls for them to invest in building their network of iot partners and collaboratorsmap out their place in a smart connected product services based economyforecast the business models that smart connected products may lead them to pursueadapt low cost sensors that may be used in their product categoriesdetermine whether to build an iot platform or buy the platform as a servicedevelop a robust security strategy for connected products datainvolve legal and compliance

business models in fact consumers and companies today are the beneficiaries of computer simulations of complex conditions ranging from weather forecasts to the performance of aircrafts that are still on the drawing boards until recently such computer simulations were largely the realm of major government entities or large companies with access to the multimillion dollar high performance computing systems required to run them now the emergence of cloud computing opens up a world of possibilities for companies that have long wanted to experiment with simulations but lacked the resources to do so in short cloud computing makes simulation opportunities abundant and economical just as important the digital data that s necessary to perform these simulations is plentiful and increasing exponentially the same cloud computing infrastructure that gave us cheaper email systems or subscription based salesforce automation software is now making sophisticated software tools many of them open sourced some available for a credit card fee available to a vastly wider audience these tools such as those that manage data exchanges among different systems make it possible to perform the calculations required for simulations other tools manage the security of corporate data for simulations and because a company can share data and computing power with partners via the cloud such platforms enable a host of new applications more companies are facing a pressing need for business data visibility across the entire supply and distribution chain to make informed planning and production decisions an automaker for example may decide it needs to go beyond its tier one suppliers to second or third tier firms to gain more control over supply timelines and prevent unexpected downtimes for assembly lines this calls for a connected ecosystem of it and processes that spans several independent companies disparate computing environments enabling the automaker to mine the data and simulate possibilities now with cloud platforms connecting a complete chain of systems becomes easier to simulate this scenario also opens possibilities for the automaker to monetize data assets like data on equipment performance transportation lead times and consumer product buying patterns by exposing such insights to ecosystem partners further by conducting simulations in a cloud vendor s data center a company can reduce the cost and risk of conducting these experiments for example a bank or a retailer planning a digital transformation can run a simulation to model the impact on the sales and profitability of integrating multiple consumer channels with significant computing power now available on demand companies have the potential to run simulations on just about anything for which they have ample quality data they make it possible to pose questions they have not been able to ask before and test more ideas but just because companies can run computer simulation models on virtually every aspect of their business does not mean they should making the best use of the requisite infrastructure analytics talent data management and it skills requires a strategy for simulations companies should determine what business questions simulations are best able to answer whether it is optimizing the supply chain pursuing an omnichannel marketing strategy or scheduling asset maintenance the approaches will vary depending on a company s industry strategy and tactics simulation sweet spotscompanies in a spectrum of industries have been doing cloud based simulations for a variety of uses for example since the beginning of the decade varian medical systems a billion scientific instruments company has been running intensive monte carlo computer simulations of design prototypes that has accelerated product development a design for a mass spectrometer that would have taken six weeks to develop using internal computing resources takes just a day in the cloud at a fraction of the cost 1university of arizona researchers looking to develop new drugs to fight als are using high performance computing resources in the public cloud to run molecular modeling simulations in just a few hours that would otherwise take months using a public cloud major league baseball built a tracking system that ingests videotaped player performance data from ballparks across north america the goal to simulate how athletes could have made better running fielding and other plays milliman a global provider of actuarial products and services for the life insurance industry has lessened the cost and complexity of its compute intensive financial modeling which evaluates thousands of economic scenarios by conducting it in the public cloud 4these early adopters have a number of characteristics in common they have ready access to huge amounts of data for example a major airline simulates the impact of flight delays on the crew management and flight scheduling it can also examine how delays affect customer loyalty revenue and crew costs by using data from multiple sources these simulation programs built using cloud based technologies increased the airline s ability to reschedule crews based on predicted delays and reduced costs on hotels and transportation for crews among other benefits they identify situations where cloud based simulations can make a big business impact companies using the cloud for simulations create use cases where the ability to predict the performance of a product service or process can significantly improve revenues or outcomes or substantially reduce costs and risks financial services firm aon benfield for example uses a high performance public cloud computing platform to simulate the performance of its five million insurance retirement products and better determine its exposure to market risks 5they do simulations to react far faster and better to daily business conditions cloud based modeling is an ideal approach for situations in which it s critical to act rapidly or in real time global food company kellogg uses public cloud infrastructure to test the impact of potential marketing programs every day it runs dozens of complex data simulations on tv ad spending digital marketing coupon campaigns and other promotions sales commissions and display and shelving costs these simulations reduce waste in making these decisions reduce time to market and boost revenue they do simulations to reveal new business models the ability to conduct multiple experiments through simulations to explore how to make a business operation more efficient or more profitable can help executives identify new ways of generating revenue simulations help answer if such ideas are feasible for example a consortium of banks can experiment with selling services to other financial institutions to help the banks comply with a new regulation seven prime use cases for cloud simulationsthere is a wide range of potential applications for cloud powered simulations we have found seven areas where many organizations are generating the greatest benefit asset management and optimization companies are using simulation modeling to predict when their assets are about to fail and may need to be repaired or replaced general electric s power water division has developed virtual plants using real time simulation in the cloud using so called digital twins of critical pieces of equipment the company can model the state of every asset in its gas power plants and wind farms research and development high performance cloud infrastructure can be valuable for product development enabling organizations to evaluate designs test performance and prevent quality issues quickly and cost effectively consumer products giant unilever for example is combining data generated in its labs with publicly available microbial genetic data to develop new deodorants and other products 8the cloud can enable similar simulation capabilities in medical research and development harvard medical school s laboratory for personalized medicine is using a cloud computing platform to develop genome analysis testing models speeding up research on the clinical value of new genetic tests pharmaceutical company novartis likewise accelerates it pre clinical r d efforts for drug development in the public cloud human capital management several companies are using cloud based simulations to recruit employees better and assign them to the right roles a company may discover that an mba graduate does not necessarily correlate with longevity with the company however it may dig deeper to discover that mbas in smaller markets are less likely to leave while those in metropolitan areas are more likely to switch jobs customer experience companies are using computer modeling techniques to predict customer receptiveness to new products services offers or product functionality from a new app to a new banking product for example one fashion retailer uses data from multiple channels sales transactions customer website visits online and mobile behavior to simulate the impact of discount offers on products at particular times such as a holiday festival to determine which will be most profitable the simulations were successful in improving repeat sales and enhanced revenues on specific product lines fraud detection many firms are using cloud resources to help identify respond to and potentially prevent fraud banking giant hsbc for example uses the public cloud in its anti money laundering efforts the bank runs analytics and machine learning on enormous data sets to identify patterns that indicate nefarious activity which it can then escalate to the appropriate government agencies customer service and field service in the same way that airlines and utilities use modeling for the predictive maintenance of their own assets cloud based simulations can help companies troubleshoot service and performance issues for customers as companies accumulate more data from internet of things connected products and field service calls they can model scenarios to create a more flexible on demand field service function inventory management using the same principle as field service simulations organizations with very remote divisions or service areas such as remote health centers can use cloud based computer models to determine how best to serve and operate their far flung units where to begincompanies that want to pursue promising simulation opportunities need to address a number of business and technical issues before proceeding tie simulations to critical business issues first and foremost organizations need to clearly define the problem they re trying to solve or the questions they re attempting to answer with computer simulation simulations are by definition experiments but that does not mean they should be undisciplined rather companies must ensure the simulations that they try have a business benefit attached practice strong data management to ensure quality simulations companies must have the right infrastructure tools and processes in place to manage the volume of data required for computer simulations and validate data quality companies must ensure that data from disparate sources are put into formats that can be combined for purposes of simulation otherwise they can create conflicts during the modeling process simulations are only as good as the data fed into them and don t forget about the team doing this work the investment of time money and talent required to prepare the data for these efforts is often underestimated and should be budgeted for from day one use simulations to fail fast and improve the next time a computer simulation is always a work in progress it must be refined over time with frequent changes to improve the model that requires a much less rigid mindset and approach than a standard software project with strict governance and delivery date computer modeling benefits from a more agile approach organizations that pursue must invest in the increased time and overhead required to supervise the process and refine results while not every business problem is right for simulation there are undoubtedly simulation opportunities for all businesses across industries and now is the time to determine where the greatest opportunities are the computing power is accessible the data is available in greater quantities and varieties than ever before if you don t take advantage of the opportunities to perform complex simulations using

41,a growing number of manufacturers are digitally connecting to their products after they leave the shop floor these companies are monitoring the experience their customers are having with those products throughout the customer lifecycle by doing so manufacturers can continue adding value to customers after the sale and even develop new revenue streams this phenomenon is especially visible in industrial manufacturing for example one turbine manufacturer is offering remote diagnostics as a service resolving of alerts remotely that reduces turbine downtime saving the customer money and the frequency of field service visits lowering its costs and customers service costs such digital connectivity allows aircraft engine makers like general electric and pratt whitney to monitor engine performance even during flights by doing so these manufacturers have evolved a new business model of servitization charging customers power by the hour rather than selling or leasing their engines outright that generates a recurring revenue stream while eliminating a significant capital expense and maintenance costs for customers a tcs global trends study found the industrial manufacturing sector was second out of global industries surveyed in what the average company spent on iot as a percentage of revenue 1all this is made possible by the internet of things iot which is increasingly penetrating all areas of manufacturing a more recent study by idc found the industrial manufacturing sector is now number one in iot spending 2the competitive advantage of a deeper customer understandinga company s ability to deeply understand how customers are using its products is transformational ge ceo jeff immelt said the new businesses his company is creating by digitally connecting its industrial products to customers operations is the most important thing ceos are going to work on at least in this era he warned ceos who fail to invest in this area do so at their own peril by intimately understanding how customers use their products manufacturers are now able to make big improvements in the customer experience in particular they can shift from reactive break fix services to predictive services that help prevent their products from breaking in the first place for example electric car maker tesla received a recall notice in from the u s national highway traffic safety administration tesla was able to fix over cars without assuming the expense of a multimillion dollar recall and without inconveniencing its customers by forcing them to drive to dealers to drop off their cars how did tesla do it simply by wirelessly releasing a software patch to the cars as caterpillar ceo doug oberhelman says our business model runs on uptime for customers if we run at a lower cost than our competition we win in this instance tesla won the manufacturer customer connection enabled by digitalization is especially critical to manufacturers beset by commoditization by adding digital services to products they can create new revenue streams and differentiate themselves and their products for many manufacturers this digitalization lets them shift from being just a maker and distributer to also providing service to customers whether they are other businesses or consumers some manufacturers hope to move from a product service ratio to to increase margins and develop recurring revenue streams 6to make this transformation a manufacturer must gain a degree view of its customers throughout the lifecycle in which they use its products this is far different from a transactional snapshot retrieved when the product is sold serviced and returned it requires shifting the focus from upfront product sales revenue to lifetime revenue from customers by having a continuous data stream flowing into its systems a manufacturer can tailor its products to how customers use them it can also allow customers to customize the product and how they use it for example when ge monitored how its engines on alitalia planes were consuming fuel the italian airline changed the wing flap positions in landings this reduced fuel use and of course alitalia s costs it was mutually beneficial for both companies and was made possible by the continuous digital monitoring that creates a more than transactional relationship 7such customer product usage data will ultimately give the manufacturers that possess it something their competitors do not have insight into what other products and services the customer will need and that will produce more than new product and revenue opportunities it will allow manufacturers to charge a premium even for commoditized goods and more importantly provide an enduring competitive advantage how manufacturers can get from here today to there tomorrow to gain this competitive advantage through digitalization manufacturers must begin by developing an overarching business strategy because they must change their business model they have to think hard about how to create and maintain that competitive advantage over time many services a company rolls out can and will be quickly copied by competitors consequently executives must think about developing products to which they can add features continuously at the same time they must simplify and lower the cost of the business processes that provide the services attached to those products digitalization has a great potential to reduce cost of operations and build trust with customers through transparent and real time visibility in sales and service manufacturers have key choices to make here one is whether to sell a product or maintain ownership and sell the product as a service i e servitization charging only for the use of the asset this is becoming the case not only with end products but also components of a product or system for example airplane engines as power by the hour and truck tires as michelin now does charging fleet owners a per kilometer rate indeed some manufacturers believe after sale transactions may be more profitable than the sale of the product itself they re launching services for repair and troubleshooting their products and selling follow on products and services such as updated gps mapping systems for automobiles another choice that manufacturers have here is about the channels for connecting with customers traditionally many manufacturers sold and serviced their products through distributors and dealers but today s digital portals let manufacturers connect directly to end customers if its strategy is one of servitization then a manufacturer must keep a rich digital connection to the products that are in customers hands if it can continually monitor the condition of its products a manufacturer can develop a more detailed and accurate picture of how to price its support services and warranties several car insurance companies are tracking their customers driving behaviors to more precisely price the policies they offer and sell additional features indeed the number of drivers now enrolled in pay how you drive programs has doubled since progressive one of america s largest car insurers has million usage based customers its policies are based on telematic technologies that use machine learning algorithms such insurers can adjust premiums on an almost real time basis which benefits them by reducing their risks and their better driving customers who pay less 9your business strategy must also determine how much income your company can retrieve not on a quarterly basis but over an extended period generally the higher the value of the product such as aircraft engines and luxury cars the greater the opportunity for after sale profits derived from digital connectivity lower value products think coffee makers toasters and barbecue grills have shorter product lifecycles they are more likely to be replaced than repaired they therefore will have a lower return on digital investment that said iot enables manufacturers of all products to make money on them after the sale the question is not if but where they can make money importantly manufacturers must develop infrastructure and partner ecosystems capable of collecting and analyzing the volumes of digital data coming from the field most manufacturers are still aggregating data above the local field level however few companies outside the energy industry collect information on a customer by customer basis that data is still owned primarily by retailers and channel partners if they have robust crm systems that s why it s so important for manufacturers to be transparent with their channel and distribution partners to get their data you must share your own that may mean sharing leads with distributors and or developing robust communication pathways to exchange product maintenance information finally manufacturers need to change their corporate mindsets from product purveyors to service providers this means focusing investments on marketing sales and above all customer relations from a financial perspective shifting revenue from immediate sales to service and product usage over time must be modeled carefully key performance metrics need to be customer focused e g customer satisfaction measures and customer lifetime value rather than sales volume and one time sales revenue your core service mindset must be about helping the customer use and get value from your products the r d function must also become customer centric it must examine product features through the customer s lens looking at enhancements that will improve the customer experience rather than adding the next new cool feature that customers may neither value nor be willing to pay for a new business eraone doesn t need a crystal ball to see that the future of manufacturing lies in developing digitally connected products that continually report back to the companies that made them or to the retailer that sold them that s why using iot technologies to improve the customer experience after the customer takes possession of a product is now so critical to the future of many manufacturers tcs the internet

42,manufacturers everywhere are using sensors software and wireless connectivity to add features to their products and differentiate them in the marketplace in this way digitization and the internet of things iot are revolutionizing the sector across categories and geographies to be sure the idea of connected products isn t news to manufacturers in general motors gm began offering its on board

leading b2b and consumer companies are rushing to connect everything they make from jet engines to tractors to refrigerators to electric toothbrushes figure illustration of a closed loop system for a typical utilities company that includes the ability to gain performance insights from customers experience using energy systems it s a trend that extends beyond major firms a myriad of startups are seeking investors for all manners of newly imagined iot enabled products at the consumer electronics show a startup called shadecraft unfurled a smart patio umbrella 2but that isn t all manufacturers are doing with connected smart products in the process of connecting their products manufacturers are unlocking a new business model this model harbors a wealth of opportunities for manufacturers to better serve their existing customers expand their markets and drive profitable revenue growth closing the value generation loopthe powerful new business model in manufacturing is enabled by a mashup of digitization and servitization that is the process of adding services to products when manufacturers add service components to a connected product they open up new ways to generate value to customers and to themselves as we describe it they gain the ability to shift from an open loop system to a closed loop system of value generation figure describes the aspects of that shift lost opportunities in open loop systems most manufacturers operate in an open loop system they sell their products to oems or through indirect distribution channels composed of wholesalers dealers and or retailers as a result manufacturers don t have direct real time sources of data that can tell them how end customers are using or misusing their products and how their products are performing or not performing they have limited insight into what benefits or problems their customers experience their data on customer usage is open meaning it escapes their reach most manufacturers are beginning to realize that this open loop system is a missed opportunity and that limited contact with end customers is a major obstacle to growth overcoming this obstacle is difficult and expensive more often than not manufacturers lose crucial data savvy manufacturers try to work with their channel partners but feedback loops break down and in many instances their channel partners simply do not or cannot gather the data in any case warranty claims arrive long after customers have been disappointed and the opportunity for a proactive response is gone even more valuable opportunities are lost in an open loop system when manufacturers don t have a direct link to their end customers they don t know and can t respond to how customers use their products or hack their products to make them do things manufacturers never imagined these are lost opportunities to build new revenue streams and enhance customer loyalty how smart connected products close the loopin a closed loop system a manufacturer has a direct and ongoing digital link to end customers access to information about the product how the customer is using it and any problems the customer may be having with it iot technologies enable manufacturers to create a closed loop system when they make their products smart and connected manufacturers that sell to oems and through indirect distribution channels can maintain a direct link to end customers moreover emerging technologies are making closed loop systems easier and more economical than ever before in communications the new 5g network standard promises much faster transmission of digital data in computing public clouds and ever more powerful processing promise to reduce costs associated with storing analyzing and gaining insights from customer product usage data closed loop systems represent a paradigm shift for most manufacturers product makers can now know the ultimate truth about their products how they are performing or not performing for customers they can receive continuous real time information about their products while those products are in the end customers hands they can understand how efficiently customers are using their products when the product is nearing a breakdown and a host of vital information closed loop systems open up a vast frontier of opportunity for manufacturers that are encompassed in the term servitization the bountiful promise of servitizationservitization is a fundamental rejiggering of the traditional manufacturing model it harks back to something harvard business school professor theodore levitt wrote years ago people don t want to buy a quarter inch drill they want a quarter inch hole 3a manufacturer that pursues servitization as strategy taps into levitt s timeless truth it shifts its primary focus from creating value by making and selling a product to creating value by delivering a service through a product the manufacturer may or may not make money selling the product itself but it does make money by providing the service embedded in the product we find that servitization opportunities come in four flavors enhancing reliability and uptime whether it s a truck boiler air compressor or any other machine manufacturers can embed monitoring services in their products then they can act or alert their customers to act before product failures occur this creates customer value by raising product reliability maximizing uptime and reducing overall maintenance costs all this builds value in the brand maersk drilling s partnership with ge is an example of this at work after a successful pilot project maersk is deploying a ge system to analyze the performance of key pieces of equipment at nine additional offshore drilling rigs the sensors on equipment enable ge to tell maersk when it s time to perform maintenance before the equipment breaks down that saves maersk time and money customer operational improvement manufacturers can embed services that optimize the value customers get from using a product for instance rolls royce s jet engines include smart technologies and connectivity that enable them to advise airlines on optimal flight speeds and other operating metrics that produce the lowest fuel costs 5automakers could provide similar services to consumers for instance advising them how to accelerate and brake in ways that maximize fuel economy so could energy utilities by tracking in real time precisely how much energy its customers are using and advising them how to reduce their costs selling new product capabilities by embedding service delivery capabilities such as software downloads in their products manufacturers can tap into new product subscription and streaming revenues toyota is offering its car owners new mapping systems and other apps that can be downloaded as software tesla has offered to sell the owners of its electric vehicles a software download that adjusts the car s suspension settings to provide them with more road clearance at high speeds new revenue generating businesses perhaps the most valuable potential of servitization is when it enables manufacturers to develop entirely new businesses they can uncover the insights that lead to such businesses by using smart connected products to gain a deeper understanding of customer experience kaeser kompressoren did this it no longer sells air compressors it sells air compression as a service as it monitors the usage of its machines one reason connected cars have spawned a competitive race in the auto industry is the many revenue generating businesses they make possible including mobile advertising imagine driving your car and getting personalized location based offers in your dashboard infotainment system a hotel just miles ahead offering a discount or a steak restaurant with tables available on a busy friday night that world will soon arrive the experience of mitsubishi hitachi power systems the maker of thermal power generation systems shows the potential of the servitization approach working with tcs the global firm is developing an artificial intelligence based system to adjust the combustion process of coal fired power plants to reduce costs and carbon dioxide emissions the system which it plans to sell to other plant operators collects nearly data inputs about the performance of a power boiler it is designed to determine how best to tune the boiler for maximum efficiency by testing more than combinations the case demonstrates the value of a closed loop system in which mitsubishi is combining its expertise in power plants with ai capabilities to sell its engineering and product knowledge as a service overcoming the resistance to servitizationthe promise of servitization is tantalizing that s why of uk manufacturers are planning to increase their investments in servitization in yet admitted they are servitization beginners they and indeed all leaders of manufacturing companies that are seeking to capture the opportunities of servitization will need to be prepared to encounter internal and external resistance that appears whenever business model change is undertaken among the challenges core business dominance every well established company has a dominant core business model the managers responsible for operating this model often find it difficult to reimagine it change can be especially challenging when it involves new and unfamiliar technologies recall that kodak executives were aware that digital photography threatened the company s survival but failed to act resistance stemming from the dominant business can remain strong even after pilots are run and proof of concept is delivered often manufacturing executives continue to project their own resistance to change on their customers either claiming customers will not pay for the service or doing little to help sell the service to customers or both approach to take conduct design thinking workshops which employ both an understanding of it systems and creative problem solving exercises that look at issues like customer challenges from different viewpoints to develop ideas for taking the business in new directions such exercises help companies to unearth new possibilities for creating value through new business ideas the process can validate the best ideas while building support for them among different stakeholders then evaluate options for a proof of concept project that will test the theory that the company s offerings can include add on services companies must assess their means to collect data on their products they are likely to determine that they need to collect more the silo trap manufacturers especially large established ones like many of the automakers are organized into silos design engineering production marketing etc that all too often operate independently that can stymie servitization initiatives approach to take engage executives across functions in a discussion of customer value assign a cross functional team to assess existing information on the customer s experience including warranty claims and problem reports and identify strengths weaknesses and opportunities to expand the view then report on options to create a pilot test of a service offering channel resistance manufacturers that launch servitization initiatives should also expect resistance from their sales distribution and service partners many dealers rely on a repairs and maintenance revenue that a new service model is expressly intended to reduce or eliminate further servitization often carries with it the very real fear of disintermediation you should expect dealers and other partners to protect their customer relationships approach to take to overcome channel resistance manufacturers much reach out to their distribution partners and make accommodations proof of concept projects can help build evidence to show the value of new models to reluctant partners customer inertia with hindsight successful products and service bundles such as apple s ipod look like they were no brainers from the start but in reality customers often do not recognize the value of service embedded products and don t immediately flock to them companies must combat such customer reluctance with effective marketing that clearly states the value of the new offering approach to take successful servitization requires a concerted effort at educating customers especially consumers on the value they would get and its price companies must overcome internal resistance and enlist employees in that effort they should begin their servitization efforts with modest projects that do not require overly complex explanations and they should be sure that customers understand both the rewards of the service model and the risks of improper use servitization is an imperativeleading manufacturers of all types are engaging in servitization sooner rather than later those that fail to embed services in their products and deliver the enhanced customer experiences that servitization promises are going to be left behind this is especially true for any manufacturer that is in an open loop system servitization offers an unprecedented opportunity to build tighter relationships with customers they can use it to add intelligence to their products collect valuable data on customer usage inform design and performance improvements and test those improvements before rolling them out at scale in short servitization enables manufacturers to improve the reliability of their products help their customers to obtain superior value and develop new revenue generating businesses the technologies needed to start embedding services in b2b and b2c products are available now no manufacturer should be waiting to

43,with digitally savvy disruptors seemingly making inroads in every sector companies using so called agile approaches to building new digital products and digital processes are becoming hard to beat in just one example the speed with which amazon com unveils new capabilities to its website dozens of changes every day has left many longstanding retailers in the dust or racing furiously to catch up even large financial services companies like ing of the netherlands have realized that they must organize and develop online systems in agile ways to keep pace with the explosion of online banking options however in the last couple of years companies that have mastered agile development have been leaping ahead in industries in which having excellent digital connections to customers is crucial to success think financial services high tech retailing and media it s why of companies are using agile approaches according to a survey the two biggest reasons they cited were to accelerate the delivery of software and to better manage changing priorities companies that introduce new online processes or online products for customers are chasing competitors that can make changes to their online offerings weekly or even daily if they used traditional approaches to building such systems they would come to market way too late and most likely off target yet not all agile projects are successful and a key reason is how they are scoped and funded companies that scope and budget their agile development projects the same way they do their traditional systems projects are likely to come up far short in two ways they lock development teams into working on features of systems that may turn out to be not worth investing in or at least spending as called for in the original plan because customers don t find them valuable in this case traditional budgeting doesn t take advantage of the ability of agile teams to put products online and test them with customers early in the process getting early feedback from customers can save a company a lot of money a firm can redirect funding away from less valuable to more valuable features they risk losing key members of their development teams who are often assigned to other systems while the current projects are waiting for the next round of funding research has found that nearly two thirds of the features built into systems using traditional development methods are rarely or never used and that the that are used provide of the value to customers 2in this article we discuss why scoping and budgeting of software projects delivered through agile development methods must be different than those used in traditional software development approaches we explain why agile methods should initially provide a high level rather than a detailed estimate of the time and the scope of effort required to deliver a system over time as they build and test components with customers the team will get a much more accurate and detailed estimate of time scope and budget we also show why companies should fund agile programs not by their scope but rather by the value that their products bring to end customers or users also known as value streams the rise of agile techniques for a digital online worldagile software development methods arrived at the turn of the 21st century a time when companies had to build e commerce websites and other systems to compete for customers on the internet with the advent of the web in the mid 1990s large companies had to develop systems that would be outward facing i e used by end customers outside their organizations not just by their internal users suddenly the traditional systems development process often referred to as using the waterfall method to depict how the phases of requirements analysis architecture coding testing and launch would follow one another across a calendar which reliably produced internal systems had become too slow off target and in other ways inadequate 3a variety of agile methods arose scrum lean extreme programming kanban and others they were different answers to the very same need to produce software much faster try it out on real customers far earlier building systems for the web made that easy since customers could use the system from their own computers and digital devices and based on that early customer feedback allow developers to make quick adjustments to the system so it wasn t obsolete the moment it went live a year or two later agile methods differed dramatically from traditional development in at least five ways scoping schedule cost estimates deliverables and key success factors to scope systems developed through traditional methods teams are asked to make detailed estimates of project length and budget after doing extensive analysis of the system s requirements the more features and functions and the more connections to other systems there are the greater the system complexity and therefore more people time and budget to do all the work in other words for traditional systems development the schedule depends on the scope of the effort estimated and the cost is a function of that scope and when the company needs the system to go live i e the schedule building a system faster requires assigning more team members and thus increases the cost yet developers know the least about the scope and thus the time and cost of a software project at the beginning their knowledge increases once they start delivering code and it keeps improving the more they deliver the key to successful software projects based on waterfall methods is doing exceptional upfront requirements analysis so that the schedule and cost turn out to be fairly accurate figure comparing agile and traditional software developmentagile development is built on this premise if developers can release pieces of a system to users early in the development process those developers will have a much better idea early in their process about the scope of the system those pieces are completed in short time frames weeks rather than months in plan do check act cycles in agile development scoping scheduling and cost estimation techniques are thus very different than they are in waterfall development see figure the problems of software budgeting in an agile worldso here we are years after the agile manifesto emerged from the primordial software development soup yet most organizations while embracing agile are still scoping and budgeting them in the same way they structured and budgeted the big monolithic systems projects of yesteryear in other words while agile development techniques are all the rage in the it organization and the business functions they automate the budget holder for technology in most companies the finance organization still doles out funding the old fashioned way by program projects or stage gates such as requirements design coding testing and so on after requirements analysis is deemed complete funds are released for the next phase system architecture and development then once that s done funding needs to be approved for system testing and so on for software development teams that build systems using agile methods this has become a big problem for several reasons it locks teams into continuing to develop pieces of software that may not be useful to customers teams get disbanded if project funding dries up valuable knowledge about the business processes of the product and technologies that enable those processes is lost the answer scoping smaller releases and funding them fasterso how should companies that need to develop systems through agile methods rethink their scoping and budgeting we believe they should make three key changes funding by value stream rather than by the entire program launching low cost high value products features first and high cost low value ones last and continuously funding and giving the development team work that s been prioritized thereby ensuring that the teams aren t on hiatus let s look at each change funding by value stream the work of agile development teams should be funded with an economic view i e how useful the product or feature is to customers or other end users let s say a retailer s top management gives its new e commerce website a full year to bring it to market developed through traditional methods none of the system would see the light of day i e be online for customers to use for that year however using agile methods e commerce and it managers would prioritize the features of the system i e price lookup product descriptions product reviews one click pricing inventory checks in store locations and so on and begin putting them online far earlier perhaps within weeks after they launched the project depending on the release cadence funding this project the traditional way would have called for drawing on its total budget at each step of the development process at the start for requirements gathering and analysis then after requirements were inspected before architecture and coding then after the architecture and coding were checked before testing and finally if the testing went well to put it into production or top management would allocate budget for the full scope of the project tying up funds for a long duration regardless of whether the project meets its intended purpose or not when it is finally completed launching high value but high cost value streams early one of the biggest advantages that agile has over traditional systems building methods is the ability to break a big monolithic system into smaller pieces and then go live with some of those pieces very early in the project even in the first few months the pieces you want to go live with first are those that everyone believes at the outset to be low cost yet high return how budgeting of agile projects needs to change during the software development lifecyclefigure adjusting the budgets for systems built through agile methodsthe market feedback that the hypothetical retailer would get from introducing pieces of its new e commerce website in weeks like those we ve discussed would be highly valuable it will reduce further funding of low value but high cost features it will continue funding of high value features and it should increase funding for features proven to have high value but which don t cost very much see figure delegating scoping and budgeting to the agile development teams the whole reason to use agile development is to come to market far faster with a new online system and get much earlier and frequent customer feedback on which features of the system to further develop or abandon hence the funding decision for agile development needs to be top down as well as dynamic as such we believe that making all this work well is best done when a company delegates the decisions on what pieces of the system to work on next to the product owners in the business who best understand their product and its performance and to the development teams who best understand how long it would take to build it of course vesting that decision in the development team requires great trust by those who fund the system the business unit finance and it heads your cfo must become comfortable with the notion that agile teams which must include product managers owner s from the business units and functions will know best what system features are delivering value or not it s why the team product owners and managers must keep reviewing what s being delivered and monitor its performance in the marketplace to utilize available funding most judiciously we don t advise companies that are new to agile development to change the way they budget overnight they need to first see the advantages of agile development and get accomplished at it but those that are proficient with agile should consider giving their teams fixed budgets and then leave the scoping decisions to the team ultimately as leadership guru stephen m r covey once wrote about trust in business whether the agile teams gain and keep the trust of senior executives will depend on the results they generate and their integrity intent and capabilities 4how this is working at a major retailerthe retailer whose name will go unmentioned is competing against amazon as are numerous other retailers these days but it realized in the last few years that how often it could update its e commerce website the systems in its stores merchandising buying and other system were critical to competing effectively in a bricks and clicks world at this retailer portfolio level budgeting is done top down with joint decision by business and it highest priority value streams5 get fixed funding for a fixed period without any elaborate bottom up cost estimations based on detailed requirements upfront in fact the company found that it had to change the organization structure of the it department to make agile methods work well so rather than being organized around it domains such as business analysis coding systems analyst testing and so on the new organization is structured by online product area point of sales applications hr applications vendor negotiation applications and so forth agile teams in each product area have the requisite business analysis systems analysis ui designers developers testers and other skills necessary to build test and go live with an online product in their area the result of embracing agile and new ways to scope and budget for agile developed systems has been sizable faster system rollouts fewer technology incidents and a workplace that lures new systems engineering talent to the company the new world of systems scoping and budgetingcompanies like the retailer mentioned above ing netflix spotify and google are leading the way on how systems scoping and budgeting must change in a world of digital systems built through agile methods those companies that embrace and master agile methods and then scope and budget for them in ways that provide highly valuable early feedback are getting a big leg up in the race to be

44,the internet of things iot opens up opportunities for companies to improve visibility of their operations and the products they make by collecting data from sensors attached to a range of machines from controllers at factories to aircraft engines but while many companies are embedding sensors and wireless communications devices into their industrial control systems and products each implementation has the potential to open up their systems to hackers who can steal data or disrupt operations in the u s iot incidents logged by the u s department of homeland security rose more than seven fold between incidents and researchers project iot will rise on the list of risks for chief information security officers cisos two thirds of computer networks will see an iot security breach by idc researchers predict adding that by of all attacks will target iot systems gartner analysts say they expect iot security costs will rise to of annual information security budgets by up from a rounding error less than in budgets iithe risks of a breach in corporate networks incorporating iot capabilities are real examples abound a regional water company saw its web based payment system and operational technology system hacked an event that led to unauthorized manipulations of its programmable logic controllers 3researchers have identified security flaws in the communications protocols used in medical devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators that can be adjusted remotely without surgery 4a demonstration by two hackers showed it was possible to gain control of a connected car with the knowledge of its ip address 5the risks extend to consumer devices that interact with corporate networks in malware called mirai hijacked iot devices such as closed circuit video cameras and digital video recorders that used factory default security settings those devices in turn attacked dyn an internet infrastructure company that underpins top websites the incident created problems for users at popular sites like amazon twitter reddit and netflix 6such incidents demonstrate why companies must lock down their connected systems and networks including the ones they use to design and manufacture their products and the connections they embed in their products the incidents show the vulnerability of interconnected systems that many parties have access to and they point to the urgency that enterprise risk management leaders confront as they seek to maintain and improve existing defenses the risks embedded in iotthe promise of iot is that its technology can automate functions that are much more expensive to do manually it s impractical to employ large operations teams to monitor all plant equipment 24x7 it s easy and relatively cheap to install sensors and connect them to a network that will alert managers to problems it s now feasible to equip advanced engines with devices that provide ongoing measures of their mechanical health but as iot deployments have spread risks have emerged manufacturers designed iot devices with functionality in mind not security iot devices are out in the field attached to company products in locations around the world and are often not monitored centrally for attacks unlike the corporate data center as a result practitioners see that attacks such as iot botnets can spread quickly because many iot devices are rarely patched or updated 7in fact the risks of iot devices being hacked are far greater than they have been for any previous technology assets deployed by companies in at least three respects the large number of devices to monitor millions in the case of a large automaker instituting cloud delivered infotainment systems or self driving cars makes the iot a larger risk to manage than the thousands of laptops desktops and mobile phones used by the employees of a major enterprisethe challenge is also more geographically dispersed due to iot sensors embedded in products and machines installed or moving through corners of the world that are often far beyond where the company has offices and employeesthe relatively new nature of the technology means there are heterogeneous platforms to manage iot devices are full of hardware and software from different vendors that make assessing vulnerabilities patching software and monitoring ongoing risks a multidimensional challengeknow what you re dealing withaddressing the iot security challenge requires an understanding of your iot landscape in detail this includes analysis of what devices you have and at which point they may be vulnerable so that you can address critical security gaps companies must establish a group that will mitigate current problems and manage future risks a comprehensive review requires eight steps appoint a centralized team accountable for iot security a centralized team that includes the ciso must be accountable for securing the company s iot devices and ensuring the firm s ongoing compliance with risk management policies to establish this team companies must evaluate the maturity in terms of in house skills and practices of their it organization and the operations technology ot organizations in some companies this exercise means confronting a cultural clash while it professionals typically have more experience managing information security based on experience and industry established best practices there nevertheless may exist a distrust between it and ot based on each group s unfamiliarity with the other a common organization that combines experts in control systems for operations facilities such as integrated control systems and it security can bridge this gap in addition standards organizations for it and ot can serve as a resource for the centralized team applying the same principles to ot devices such as the iso standard8 for information security management systems and the isa iec standard to prevent cyber attacks on industrial operations 9once set up the centralized team can monitor control systems compliance with corporate policies for managing iot devicesensure that software patches are up to date for plant instrumentation iot devices and infrastructurerun regular audits for security practicesconduct constant network monitoringthe team should also incorporate new best practices that emerge for iot devices for example industrial service providers including ge s achilles program certify devices and the organizations that implement them for compliance to the iec standard others provide iec assessment services to organizations that deploy industrial systems in addition device manufacturers can provide maintenance and support remotely for their products while a potential benefit to companies deploying iot devices such remote access must be controlled and secure locate your company s critical iot assets the first priority is to identify all the connected devices and sensors your company uses and then determine which ones represent a significant security risk companies often discover assets about which they were previously unaware you must also distinguish between those assets that signify important risks and those that do not not every asset is critical in some cases the risk of a breach occurring through a particular device is less urgent than the resources required to address the remote chance of a problem with all that said these assets are likely to be distributed across enterprise networks and geographical locations and may be found in isolated networks within industrial plants they will be present in both it systems and ot systems including end point devices such as pcs laptops smartphones tablets and other mobile computersdevices that move with transportation containers trucks and shipsindustrial control systems managed by supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems in factories and other facilitieslegacy infrastructure such as the controllers that utilities use to manage flows of electricity water and natural gas identify the software vulnerabilities in your iot assets software vulnerabilities are the most significant risk facing iot connected devices with an inventory of critical assets in hand a company can assess which software governs the actions of each piece of hardware different device manufacturers use their own conventions in software protocols and each requires an assessment of its vulnerabilities for example can a hacker exploit it remotely how can such a weakness be fixed for some devices changing the security settings in the product that was shipped can be enough to address a risk for others such as various generations of windows devices there may be known network vulnerabilities for which an immediate patch is available failure to update software can leave systems susceptible to attacks such as the one that occurred in may when a variant of the wannacry ransomware program infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide it is imperative to maintain updated software patches on critical assets discover devices that gain entry to your networks as companies assess their own devices and software it is important to understand when new devices whether they are company owned or devices used by customers business partners or contractors access corporate networks where possible use technology that can automate the discovery of new devices however you must manually detect isolated networks at industrial sites that support your iot devices assess the vulnerability of these devices and execute patches on them if they are owned by external parties require the parties to do the same watch out for emerging threats monitor all connected devices for evidence of new threats such as distributed denial of service attacks such attacks often arise from either a software developer error or the open source software community as hackers seek to exploit uncovered vulnerabilities in software code isolate the devices that are the target of threats and apply software patches to them inspect new devices before they connect establish a process for ensuring that new devices purchased or added include security features in their hardware software and network connection and that the security features are updated demand best practices from your business partners make certain that the business partners that have access to your networks also have strong security programs and that they demonstrate compliance with your procedures for example a repairs contractor which needs to access connected systems and devices must have implemented security measures such as software updates and comply with your company s policies before it can enter your network have backups ready a cyber security program for iot systems fits into a broader corporate risk management program incorporate its elements into existing plans for disaster recovery and business continuity already established to deal with a system breach include information about iot security in the company s incidents communications strategy iot security in action three casesthe experiences of three companies we have worked with show how iot cyber security can work manufacturing firm strengthens its ot securitysituation at a manufacturing company executives understood their plant floors had embedded software and wi fi network connections in a typical mix of legacy equipment and newer devices such assets included programmable logic controllers plcs supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and human machine interfaces hmis to control industrial processes the company had other connected devices including equipment for its field support crews business continuity and incident management programs actions taken the company deployed non invasive software tools designed for it systems and customized to work with ot network protocols to scan all of its devices for vulnerabilities the tools identified vulnerabilities and the company then repaired them after finishing this process at one factory the company repeated the process at other factories takeaway by applying best information security practices developed for it systems this company was able to identify and remediate security risks in its operations building on its record the company was able to monitor its devices and systems and update its practices to address future vulnerabilities utility establishes ot security roadmapsituation concerned that its iot devices presented a security risk leaders at a utility company sought to identify problems and solutions actions taken the company began a to month assessment of its organization s security capabilities in addition to its security practices and controls adapting the iso it standard developed for ot security assets evaluated will include controllers hmis asset management systems as well as equipment for the field service organization the assessment also will examine how ot security should be included in its incident management plans and business continuity program the assessment will identify high value assets that need immediate attention as well as other measures the company must execute as part of a comprehensive ot security management plan takeaway by adapting best security practices for iot devices the company is strengthening its risk management posture company establishes security governance program otsituation after performing an iot security assessment executives at a utility company sought to develop capabilities to manage cyber security actions taken the company adapted it best practices for its ot organization it defined ot security policies it established an ot security governance process with defined roles and responsibilities it set metrics for governance procedures and security actions it scheduled regular reports for the ot organization to update executives on the security status of its iot assets takeaway an ot organization can establish strong information security governance to mitigate iot security risks manage risks while capitalizing on iot benefitsin the excitement to take advantage of iot companies today must assess the risks of a security breach or loss of control of important operational systems firms that demand secured technology will lay a strong foundation for ongoing risk management efforts programs to prevent a security problem such as updating and patching systems and procedures to deal with any security disruption will enable companies to prepare for the worst as they seek to make good on the promise of this powerful technology throughout these efforts executives should ensure that it and ot devote their experts time to collaboration the ciso should play a role while it and ot leaders in a central group monitor conditions follow best practices to mitigate risks that exist and respond to incidents a strong cyber security strategy includes continuous testing for and addressing of vulnerabilities in iot devices charles

45,industries are being reordered today by the confluence of four technologies cloud computing which makes supercomputing power affordable even for startup firms artificial intelligence which ups the iq of products people and processes big data and analytics which turn operational chaos into coherency and the internet of things which lets us track products people customers and premises around the clock around the world but why do so many companies ignore the transformation that is happening now around them in their new book mit professors andrew mcafee and erik brynjolfsson argue as kuhn did about scientific revolutions that it is difficult to change long accepted beliefs existing processes customers and suppliers pools of expertise and more general mindsets can all blind incumbents to things that should be obvious such as the possibilities of new technologies that depart greatly from the status quo they write in machine platform crowd harnessing our digital future it s why so many of the smartest and most experienced people and companies … are the least able to see a transformation that they won t escape is such blindness avoidable i think so to do so senior executives need to sharpen or develop five traits that may have sat dormant in them but which i think reside in all of us these traits helped the executives running three of the most successful companies of the last years apple amazon and netflix rapidly recognize the potential of ai and automation cloud computing iot and big data and how they would transform their businesses those traits are i ll explain each trait and why the confluence of the technologies i mentioned puts them at a premium today in the c suite to illustrate them i m going to show how they played out at apple amazon and netflix under steve jobs apple transformed itself from a failing maker of desktop computers to a mobile device and computer company that has redefined the music media photographic and telecommunications industries rejoining the company in years ago when it was nearly bankrupt jobs had lifted it to more than billion in annual revenue and a net profit of billion at the time of his death in since then apple s revenue has doubled again to billion in under ceo tim cook since jeff bezos has been expanding amazon s business beyond online retailing to cloud computing services this year aws revenue is on track to exceed billion and its operating income is larger than that of amazon s retail business even though its revenue is eight times greater than aws perhaps better than any other company amazon acted early on the convergence of cloud big data and automation said werner vogels the firm s cto amazon web services was always considered a business by itself with the expectation that it could even grow as big as the amazon com retail operation 4reed hastings has presided over two transformations at netflix its switch from distributing movies through the mail to streaming them online and then getting into movie and tv programming business itself in years netflix has gone from a startup to almost billion in annual revenue with a market cap in july of nearly billion 5while the stories of these companies are well known the five characteristics that their executives share aren t as well understood here are those traits and how they helped their leaders dissect the vast opportunities of a new technological wave the imagination to see what others didn tnetflix founder reed hastings launched netflix years ago knowing that the technology of that time to distribute movies was going to change dramatically after the proliferation of high bandwidth internet networks in a recent interview with venture capitalist marc andreessen hastings explained that putting dvds in the mail was a weigh station to a streaming future we always viewed the dvd by mail as a digital distribution network the product–movies encoded in digital form on disks–were in fact digital when it was technically and economically possible in the last decade for those digits to be shipped online the netflix business would need to change in comparison his earliest big competitor blockbuster was run by executives who fell in love with stores hastings says says hastings that s why we called the company netflix rather than dvd by mail or that kind of thing we had the slight advantage that we would not fall in love with our first business netflix also had the imagination to predict that it couldn t remain only a movie and tv programming distributor cable and telecommunications companies were wiring up their communities with broadband and they d be able to distribute the same fare that netflix could netflix had to also be in the content business–creating its own tv series in fact last year the company spent billion on such programming and said it would spend another billion on it this year 7in other words the top management at netflix had the imagination to know that they had to transform their offerings beyond renting movies that are produced by other firms they knew at some point they had to be in the movie and tv show production business too all in all hastings and his team had the imagination to see where their business was headed and they acted first netflix has more than subscribers now to its video streaming business worldwide half of whom are outside its u s base blockbuster which didn t have the imagination to see and action on the future is long gone hastings realizes netflix s success can be a damper on imagination at his firm but he knows he can t fall into the trap as he said to andreessen the lack of imagination amongst us leaders can be very high it s easy to look at guys like ken olsen the founding ceo of digital equipment corp and say what idiots but in fact they are us jeff bezos also recently lamented the lack of imagination across industries about the opportunities for companies he believes big technological trends are easy to identify but strangely hard for large organizations to embrace bezos pointed recently to a big trend that is an obvious one right now –machine learning and artificial intelligence amazon has been experimenting with putting machine learning to use for years–for example in its delivery drones and alexa cloud based ai assistant 9a voracious appetite for compelling and competing ideasthe c suite of any company is not likely to be as imaginative as it needs to be these days if only one person–the ceo–is allowed to do the imagining according to steve jobs appointed biographer the co founder of apple and the firm s lead transformer of the music computer cellphone and other industries was not some lone inventor who dreamed strong ideas and told others to execute them he sought out team members with great ideas and the fortitude to convince him they were right i can tell people in a meeting that they re wrong but they can bark back at me and tell me i m wrong wrote walter isaacson in jobs biography and then we have the most rip roaring arguments and that s why we work together well we have wonderful arguments if you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to be run by ideas not by hierarchy the best ideas have to win otherwise good people don t stay 80jobs and his apple executive team had many heated debates about company strategy what products to pursue and so on but jobs made sure his ideas didn t stamp out the concepts of others before he died jobs told a technology conference that great ideas–and internal debates about them–were paramount in companies no matter where those ideas came from we have wonderful arguments if you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to be run by ideas not by hierarchy the best ideas have to win otherwise good people don t stay 11great ideas for the future–not those of the past–were what jobs cared about said current ceo tim cook another thing steve taught us all was not to focus on the past be future focused if you ve done something great or terrible in the past forget it and go on and create the next thing 12a relentless customer advocatejeff bezos has had a laser focus on investments and improvements that have kept amazon s customers loyal and buying even more from the company as he said in his letter to shareholders we will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers 13amazon s growth speaks volumes to the promise that bezos has kept since then the way amazon views the technology convergence that s now upon us is through the lens of customer value how can cloud ai automation and iot help the company generate unprecedented value for its global customers from the start of his company bezos has avoided getting distracted by the technologies swirling around it as he told a large employee group this spring there are many ways to center a business you can be competitor focused you can be product focused you can be technology focused you can be business model focused and there are more but in my view obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of long term vitality 14exuding calmness in the stormtumultuous market changes can distract an executive team bezos true north amidst his company s technological and competitive storm has always been the customer netflix founder hastings too has found it necessary not to worry incessantly about what competitors are doing even those with much deeper pockets people say things like only the paranoid survive he said repeating the title of a book by andrew grove the legendary ex ceo of intel it encodes a truth in a way but it oversimplifies it because paranoid people are delusional explained hastings and when executives get delusional they get totally distracted on the wrong threats hastings said he should know when netflix s primary business was distributing movie dvds through the mail its competitors were much bigger companies with bigger coffers blockbuster walmart and others suddenly we were up against much larger companies we got through it by not getting psyched out but by focusing on improving service hastings said in his interview we spend a very small amount of time thinking about the competition and most of the time about improving our service because there is nothing we can do about the competition that is hastings has remained calm no matter how many competitors there are today and on the horizon loyalty to great people but not to their current jobsone of ai s greatest challenges for big companies is this making sure their most valuable people don t leave because of the fear their jobs will be automated one of the least recognized characteristics of the leaders at apple netflix and amazon has been their ability to retain valuable people even if those whose jobs had to shift steve jobs stayed loyal to the executives who had helped him at pixar and next he took many of them with him when he returned to apple in and many of them stayed as apple evolved from a computer company to a computer digital device smartphone and music distribution company the ability to recognize talent and redeploy it when the work and products of a company must change will be an increasingly important one in a world of ai and automation top executives must be unsentimental about the work of the organization that can be improved by being automated or outsourced however they must be sentimental to highly valuable people who occupy those jobs and are ready to put their talent into something new the five traits of abundant imagination a hunger for ideas an unrelenting focus on giving customers more and more staying calm in the competitive storm and staying loyal to great people but not to their old jobs are now vital in just about every large company if you have them they will go a long way in helping your firm to transform

46,vijay govindarajan is the coxe distinguished professor at dartmouth s tuck school of business and a marvin bower fellow at harvard business school he is the author of the three box solution a strategy for leading innovation hbr press april today s most innovative and successful companies are able to master three boxes says innovation thought leader vijay govindarajan in the digital era companies must get much better at box escaping the traps of the past falls within the realm of corporate culture described by many leaders as the hardest part of digital business transformation govindarajan shares ideas with tcs about developing a culture suited to an age of accelerated change tcs why is it so hard for leaders to escape the traps of the past even in the digital business age when they are being urged along at high speed vijay govindarajan if you cannot forget you cannot create new things yet forgetting is so difficult what you need to forget still has value today but it will become a weakness in the future the u s automobile industry grew up in an era when mechanical engineering was a core competency in the last couple of years with autonomous vehicles and the sharing economy the auto industry is transforming to prioritize computer science artificial intelligence and so on for auto companies to forget that the core competency is mechanical engineering is very difficult because today their executives still taste success and today s success is still based on mechanical engineering looking ahead it is a future weakness tcs what can leaders do to accelerate the pace of culture change inside their companies govindarajan you have to be careful when defining the parts of the company where you want to change the culture a wholesale change in culture is not needed in all companies if you go back to the auto industry for a moment what you want to change is the part of the organization that has to experiment and learn new things such as electric cars or driverless cars in many instances you want a selective approach tcs are there companies that stand out for executing quickly on culture in this digital age govindarajan the best way to do it is to create a dedicated team focused on bringing about a fundamentally different culture ge is doing this ge s industrial businesses are not going away but ge is trying to transform itself from an industrial company into an information company so ge is launching this breakthrough business model based on the industrial internet ge s term for connected devices that is a fundamentally different business model when compared to the core business therefore they have created ge digital where the culture is very different from ge s core business tcs could you point out some things that ge is doing right with regard to culture change govindarajan you do not directly change culture culture is an outcome variable what you do is change the rewards system you change the kinds of people you hire ge created a separate team in silicon valley that brings about a culture change second they recruited very different people in the thousands they allowed them to have a different process a much leaner experimental adaptive kind of a mindset they were not held accountable for short term financial results but on their ability to test and learn about assumptions this is how you change the culture that does not mean the same culture change is happening in the core business create a dedicated team focused on bringing about a fundamentally different culture tcs yet there are many examples of big companies that set up silicon valley teams to bring innovation and culture change to the rest of the company but which did not work as well xerox which set up its palo alto research center in the 1970s was one of them xerox parc created several great personal computing innovations but other companies capitalized on them so are there any cultural lessons to be learned for ge and others that have been setting up shop in silicon valley govindarajan first xerox parc was just an r d lab we should not mistake r d for creating new businesses or business models r d is a source second xerox parc was created as an island and it was not connected to the businesses of xerox in any rigorous way ultimately the success will come only if you create a dedicated team in silicon valley that is strongly connected to the mother ship in the ge case ge digital is strongly connected that is the only way ge can win against the silicon valley startups tcs for companies that have identified the part of the business they want to change is there such a thing as moving too fast govindarajan absolutely moving too fast is not doing low cost low risk experiments as a way to understand the territory moving too fast is scaling up the new business model without understanding the unknowns the next big things are always full of unknowns you can move too fast because you think speed to market is important everybody is facing the same set of unknowns learn fast before you move fast the need for change has to start at the top the other problem is companies try to do too many new things they jump in and start too many initiatives that is part of the reasons so many firms fail if you tell companies you are doing too much it really resonates with them not only are resources thinly allocated you are also letting a lot of projects without promise proceed then you throw good money after bad money you need to spend a little bit learn and then spend more tcs what are the techniques or strategies that leaders can use to get their teams to buy into the need for change govindarajan it really has to start at the top that is the key if the ceo does not see that multiple cultures can exist inside the same company it is not going to happen the ceo needs to articulate that having different cultures does not mean that one culture is superior to another it just means that the need is different and that you require a variety of capabilities different processes alternate metrics in one part of the organization it is communication and more communication the best way to communicate may not be to just talk but also to make other visible statements sometimes you might want to let go of someone who is resisting this kind of culture change even if that person is a high performer letting go of a high performer sends a strong signal that you really believe in the importance of change tcs what we are describing here is a federated model for companies where you have a core group focusing on the established parts of the business and a separate group focusing on a new business opportunity is there a risk to that model govindarajan that separate group should be strongly connected to the mothership i am not recommending skunkworks projects they are all mistakes in my opinion what i am recommending is a distinct team with specific tasks skunkworks gives the image of someone working in the basement subverting the systems we want people to be collaborative and cooperative what is the downside if not managed properly this can create all kinds of conflict tcs what kinds of connections to the mother ship are we talking about govindarajan the connections have to be where there is a significant asset in the core business that you can leverage so if you go back to the ge example the significant asset is the information that is embedded in the business the connection between ge digital and ge healthcare has to be around machines generating patient data tcs do many of the companies that were born digital believe they are immune to the box trap that they cannot get trapped by the past govindarajan yes typically silicon valley companies think the three box framework does not apply to them but in the pure internet business someone else s ability to imitate what you are doing is high box breakthrough ideas will become box current core business operations very quickly that is why they face the box problem escaping the traps of the past even more than industrial companies they just do not realize it that is why google set up the alphabet companies created the separate dedicated teams for driverless cars and robotics and virtual reality businesses tcs in companies like google alphabet what are the key elements of healthy culture govindarajan these companies realize there are two types of innovation linear and non linear linear is to improve your current business non linear is to create new business models you have to manage both with different processes metrics and people that will result in different cultures too accepting that is critical we must understand that there are two different sets of talents that ceos need to manage,changing culture in a time of

47,in the age of big data companies have unprecedented access to information on everything from connected iot products to customer opinions but collecting large amounts of data and wringing business value from it are two different things and most companies struggle greatly with the latter what is holding companies back from achieving greater roi which aspects of analytics are important looking forward which are over hyped to delve into these questions tcs spoke with prabhudev konana the william h seay centennial professor of information management and past chairman of the department of information risk and operations management in the mccombs school of business at university of texas at austin where he founded the master of science in business analytics degree program the real analytics struggle for many companies starts at the beginning says konana knowing the right business questions to ask as you analyze data is vital if you do not ask the right questions you will never realize significant roi tcs how do forward looking companies measure the success of analytics projects and which emerging metrics might be important in a few years time prabhudev konana the most important business metric is the basic one dollars and cents many companies are using social media analytics to target the right customers but at the end of the day are they converting those potential customers into real customers that is the biggest missing piece in analytics today how it affects top line and bottom line growth once you answer that question you can drill down to the more operational level and choose the right metrics to support that growth for example if you are dealing with credit card fraud detection your metrics can gauge whether you are reducing fraud situations or flagging incidents before they happen if you are looking at security issues your metrics should be able to detect intrusions and spot potential security violations early however the benefits eventually become elusive when these metrics inevitably become widely used and part of the status quo for example competitors might invest in metrics that measure customer retention for the same customer base so every time that you improve somebody else improves too so it has less and less of an impact on the bottom line but it will hurt you if you do not make the investment in analytics companies that have superior analytics capabilities in the marketplace will benefit others may perennially play a catch up game tcs today companies can tap into a range of data sources social media mobile apps geolocation data government databases and news feeds which emerging data sources intrigue you konana the biggest source is going to be the internet of things which is making it possible to collect massive amounts of data including mobile data from smart cars and driverless cars data from the iot is creating smart homes and we are moving towards smart cities healthcare is going to be massive in this area we will see lots of new interesting data sources coming in my problem is that over of companies still have no idea what to do with social media data mobile data location data and so on we are still learning iot is the next big thing but some companies are still struggling with what to do with facebook data we are still trying to master the existing data sources to create value tcs many business users are frustrated with today s data analysis dashboards because they are not terribly usable do you have any thoughts on what is coming and if that situation will improve any time soon konana i think it is going to get better the old dashboards had problems because they were not fully integrated and companies had to force fit the information sources eventually we are going to see micro level dashboards that are more meaningful they will show things such as this is our business target this is what you will reach this is how we can get there this is a shortfall you can see these kinds of dashboards appearing at the business unit level and at the corporate level over of companies still have no idea what to do with social media data mobile data location data and so on the behavioral side must be managed though dashboards can backfire because if everything goes well people may feel complacent and when things are not going well they may panic having too much information on the dashboard can hurt the morale of the company and the way people work nonetheless dashboards can be powerful tcs can you share an example of a company that you think is doing a better than average job of getting roi from its analytics konana very few companies come anywhere close to the amazons and starbucks of the world the new generation companies traditional large companies have a tougher time especially if they need to integrate their analytics for online and offline sales comparing internet years and the traditional years is like comparing human years and dog years a traditional company can spend seven years to develop the degree of integration that a new generation company can do in one year that being said analytics is still a strategic necessity for any kind of company today and if you do not do it you are finished best buy has done an extremely good job in using analytics while we all focus on the problem of showrooming visiting the best buy store and then scouting for the best deal online best buy is investing lots of resources to understand what people are saying what they might buy and how they might be influenced they are using facebook and other social media very well home depot is another example tcs visualization technology looks to be an important trend for companies seeking better ways to present data to business users what do you think konana visualization is important but it is really the last stage of the analytics process when you are presenting insights to senior management before that can happen people must define what they want from the analytics a lot of senior managers say that their industry is moving fast and there is lot of hype about visualization so it is something the company should be doing however when you drill down many companies still do not know what questions to ask along with not being clear on what visualization and analytics should accomplish senior managers are often disconnected from the talent in the company who can do the actual dirty work of analysis and bring it to them this is a classic business it alignment problem tcs companies are fighting for scarce analytics talent how important will it be for companies to train up analytics expertise in house in addition to hiring outside analytics talent konana analytics by definition is very technical and quantitative and it gets harder to teach the longer a person has been away from mathematics many big name companies found this out when they tried to bring in people with four or five years experience and make them into analytics specialists many of them had forgotten their math because they had not done it for years bringing in people with math skills intact but with less business experience brings a different set of problems they often do not fully grasp the complexities of what needs to be analyzed those who understand the math often can not explain how it relates to their company s or customers goals sometimes that means completely detaching from all the complexities of the predictive models and explaining something simply that is not easy to do that is why the university of texas requires students to learn accounting and finance along with analytics we do this because even though they might do social network analysis they must be able to relate all these metrics to business growth these metrics are the ones that count tcs which aspects of the future of analytics are perhaps overhyped konana the use of social media is one companies have been bragging about using social media surfing data and analyzing location data these are noisy messy data sets and you need specialized people to be able to do it i have a feeling that many companies will fail trying to create those capabilities inside the firm the real hype is that somehow analytics is going to magically change your business you still need a well defined strategy and you have got to use data in order to push your strategy ahead tcs what excites you about the future of analytics konana healthcare hospitals are trying to analyze data so they can understand for example drug interactions or early symptoms according to a recent new york times article microsoft researchers were able to identify symptoms for cancer by analyzing an individual s web searches this could quickly identify people at risk for cancer the challenge will be embedding healthcare analytics capabilities into tools where people do not really have to understand programming to use the data productively another exciting tool is sentiment extraction for example what are people saying about my product products are being developed that help companies figure this out without doing massive programming you just feed the data and the technology has the capabilities to do it,analytics a still emerging business frontier interview with prabhudev konana
48,a globally celebrated advisor to executives at top companies ram charan specializes in practical solutions to the most vexing problems facing industries for the last four decades he has worked with ceos boards and business unit heads at such companies as general electric bank of america dupont meadwestvaco novartis emc 3m verizon grupo rbs and the tata group jack welch ge s legendary former ceo says charan has the rare ability to distill meaningful from meaningless and transfer it in a quiet effective way without destroying confidences named by fortune magazine in as the most influential consultant alive charan is a prolific author of business books since they have collectively sold more than million copies in more than a dozen languages execution the discipline of getting things done co authored with ex honeywell ceo larry bossidy was on the new york times best seller list for more than weeks it and two other charan books were wall street journal bestsellers charan s most recent book is titled the attacker s advantage turning uncertainty into breakthrough opportunities public affairs in it charan asserts that structural uncertainty driven most of all by digital technology will continue to shake even venerable long established companies and industries to their foundations leaders and their businesses can thrive only if they know how to spot the very beginnings of change and harness it to their advantage before anyone else does charan discussed these challenges in a recent interview with editors of tcs perspectives tcs one of the tenets of your book is that taking control of uncertainty is the fundamental leadership challenge of our time why is this so important today ram charan structural uncertainty in every industry is happening much more frequently than ever before it is quite different from the seasonal and even cyclical uncertainty that companies have learned to manage structural uncertainty can come from surprising places it can explode the existing structure of your marketplace and your industry and it can eliminate companies that do not anticipate it and deal with it well leaders must expect uncertainty but even more they need to know how to take advantage of it human beings create almost all structural uncertainties and the seeds of that uncertainty are there in the present and the past but they are very difficult to detect you must focus hard to see it and understand who is behind it you must anticipate the forces that might enable these seeds of uncertainty to take hold and become big and unstoppable one of the classic examples of this is the structural uncertainty that steve jobs and apple created for nokia in the early 2000s nokia was the no mobile phone maker in the world and had patents on its handsets before it unleashed its first iphone in june apple had been filing patents on it in fact more than despite the publicly available information the nokia leadership team just didn t believe a computer company could be a threat to their cellphone business as a result nokia didn t prepare itself quickly enough for apple s onslaught had nokia been prepared it would have recognized that change was coming and positioned itself to ride the change rather than be engulfed by it tcs which structural uncertainty presents the biggest single threat to established companies charan today the most unstoppable uncertainty for most legacy companies is the onslaught of digital companies that use algorithms born digital companies google facebook amazon are experts in algorithms which are sets of rules that tell computers what to do with data that has been converted into numeric digits algorithms and their related software can process huge amounts of data and predict the outcomes of decisions with multiple variables at lightning speed this is the new game what i call the algorithmic revolution is as important to shaking up industry structures as the internal combustion engine was in the mid 1800s no company will escape it companies that have these mathematical capabilities will thrive those that delay or rail against the new reality will be punished badly as nokia motorola and kodak were tcs so do legacy firms have an inherent disadvantage over the born digitals charan the greatest disadvantage of legacy companies is their mindset and their lack of courage to do what they need to do they actually have an advantage that born digital companies lack domain knowledge and the expertise needed to service the customer domain needs are serviced best by legacy companies it is much harder for born digital companies to do some leaders of legacy companies understand this and use it to their advantage others never will tcs in the attacker s advantage you talk about five skills you believe leaders must possess to be able to see the big bends in the road perceptual acuity a mindset to see opportunity and uncertainty the ability to see a new path forward and commit to that new path adeptness in managing the transition to that new path and skills in making an organization steerable and agile can you say a little bit about each one starting with perceptual acuity charan because people create the future and it is easy and inexpensive to access the internet more than billion people today can express themselves take action create innovations and shake up an industry this means that all companies must build the ability to see over the horizon and predict which of the existing seeds of uncertainty will take hold and reshape the future we have to practice this perceptual skill constantly so it will improve tcs what about the second skill the mindset to see opportunity and uncertainty what kind of mindset is necessary charan uncertainty can be a negative if your mindset is pessimistic the best leaders see uncertainty as a great opportunity the smart phone was a great opportunity for somebody and a problem for somebody else so the question everybody should ask is i can see the uncertainty but if i were not in this business how would i make money from it tcs your third element is the ability to see a new path forward and commit to it what are the most important elements to doing that charan a business exists to discover a customer s need and fill it leaders must discover how an uncertainty will reshape that need and find a new path to filling it something that will create benefit for the customer and make money for the business the new path might require designing and delivering a current need in a new way or filling a different need altogether uncertainty changes the landscape and that landscape might create a new need or maybe a different need or maybe the same need addressed in a different way a ceo who cannot see this or respond to it will have difficulties tcs and what about the fourth skill adeptness in managing this transition to the new path in your book you talk about having two tracks one to make sure you do not mismanage your current business but the other to build your new business at the same time charan this is the new challenge for most ceos first they have got to realize how fast their existing business will decline if they do not do digitization and algorithms if they do not move quickly they will have nothing left or will have so little left that they cannot come back they need to see how quickly they must add these capabilities and figure how they can get the resources to fund it they also must manage the existing business so they do not accelerate its demise now the positive news is that legacy companies know their customers and have an embedded base they must simply find a way to create a need that they can satisfy and redefine the end to end customer experience before they needed only to produce a product and use the linear system of distributors wholesalers and other channels to get it to market now you have got to think imaginatively about the whole experience of the customer and the other players involved from start to finish the companies that can do that and that use the power of digitization and algorithms are going to make it tcs so let us talk about the fifth skill making an organization steerable and agile charan here is an analogy cars and airplanes are steerable and they are designed that way but most companies steer their strategies and goals only once a year as if the sun rises on january 1st and goes down december 31st in between is a lot of rigidity especially when it comes to budgets and people companies must be able to respond more quickly within their yearly strategic planning cycle to changes that take place on the outside in how they allocate budgets how they define what people do and design incentives for them and in the key performance indicators they use they must have the levers in place that let them steer quickly when needed tcs you mention in your book that it is a sin that the most talented people in a company often are not allowed to move from their division product line or function to other areas of that company that actually need them more to make the company more steerable tell us more about that charan this happens a lot and because of the fast exponential change on the outside that rigidity is a negative big companies should not allow their most valuable employees to be locked up within divisions or business units key talent should be seen as a pool and the ceo must be convinced to put policies in effect that make it easier to move that talent around using either pull or push incentives at ge under jack welch top management would review their divisions twice a year they knew where the top performers were and they moved the talent when necessary it was not up to the division heads that policy has been in place for years and there is not much resistance because if one division head gives up a talent he or she also gets one it is not a net loss they are giving and receiving tcs among big global companies is ge fairly unique about that system and its ability to very quickly deploy talent across geographies and divisions charan ge has the best system but unilever also does it they know the value of it tcs on this topic of navigating uncertainty to uncover breakthrough opportunities is there anything else we should think about charan if you ask people their opinion of another company or industry they make very good observations but they cannot see their own that clearly all leaders and managers need to look at their world from the outside in most of them have grown inside out if you look at the world inside out your lens has a very narrow scope if you look from the outside into your business your lens is broader if you do not practice that you will suffer,attacking uncertainty

49,bruce temkin is managing partner of the temkin group a newton massachusetts based research consulting and training firm that helps companies become more customer centric prior to launching temkin group he was a vice president at forrester research for nearly years where in his last years there he focused on customer experience creating the firm s customer experience index rankings and earning the most read analyst title for consecutive quarters tcs you ve spoken about four core competencies for a superior customer experience purposeful leadership compelling brand values customer connectedness and employee engagement why do you believe they are instrumental bruce temkin there is a compelling reason for each one look at purposeful leadership our work is geared towards large organizations if an organization has tens of thousands of people it s really important that everyone is heading in the same direction purposeful leadership is about having leaders who share a compelling view of the future and their values so everyone in the organization makes consistent decisions it s an attitude to the effect of i ll explain why we re heading somewhere and show you where we re aiming to go and hopefully all the people in the organization follow with a clear purpose you get alignment and that makes for a powerful organization tcs what companies do you consider to be exemplary in purposeful leadership temkin you see purposeful leadership in individual leaders not just in organizations but usaa is one company where the values are well understood across the organization no one questions that the organization is committed to making decisions that are consistent with its mission of helping members of the u s military and their families attain financial security usaa s leaders make decisions that are consistent with those values all the time that s another element of purposeful leadership it s not just about saying we re heading here our customers are important and we operate this way purpose truly shines through when an organization makes decisions that are consistent with that mission even when making them is difficult tcs what about compelling brand values temkin a lot of people have misconceptions about what customer experience really is you often hear that you must wow the customer with every interaction while that sounds great it s not possible given that no one has unlimited resources so what s really important is that we create the experiences that live up to our brand that means defining a set of promises to customers and prioritizing efforts around keeping those promises tcs people are so quick to comment on social media about a negative customer experience it seems easy for companies to say they have to wow customers at every touchpoint or the negative stuff will go viral is it difficult for companies to hold to even a minimal standard for the customer experience when a brand can be so easily tarnished temkin the ability to share bad experiences across a wider audience through social media is something that you never would have had to deal with years ago but the principles for dealing with those issues haven t changed every large organization is going to have some customers who have a bad experience customer centric organizations recognize when something doesn t match their values or brand then they rapidly rectify those issues and work quickly to keep them from affecting other customers understanding who we are as a company transcends any individual interaction whether it is a great one or a bad one i ll make a recently relevant example to make the point let s say that an airline has a belligerent passenger who is disturbing everyone and its employees are able to politely convince him to get off the plane if that passenger complains that is not a bad thing the airline did something consistent with its brand values which was to not allow one passenger to disrupt everyone else even though you might get a bad tweet and bad press that shouldn t move you away from your values knowing where to focus your energy doesn t mean that you serve people terribly outside of key moments but you don t need to wow them in every single instance tcs so social media makes the brand values more important right temkin yes it also forces you to move quickly but keep from overreacting to situations if someone has a bad experience with your company you want employees and customers to think you know that doesn t sound like the company i ve dealt with if they think that way then they ll discount what they hear on social media since they don t believe it s indicative of who that company is companies that are customer centric also earn a lot more forgiveness that helps them stay consistent with their brand values even when there are individual incidents there are two components one is having a continual flow of information about what customers are seeing thinking and feeling not just once from some survey you send out every year the other is basing decisions on that information tcs what does customer connectedness mean temkin customer connectedness is about making sure that insights about customers are driving decisions across the organization there are two components one is having a continual flow of information about what customers are seeing thinking and feeling not just once from some survey you send out every year the other is basing decisions on that information lots of companies have elaborate voice of the customer programs and dashboards full of data but they don t act on the insights they have they behave as if the constraint is getting data about customers the more difficult thing is having an organization that is prepared ready and able to change its way of doing things based on the insights it gets that is putting in place nimble operations so that when a company learns something about customers it can quickly do something about that insight one technology company that we re working with has a lean development process where it breaks product releases into shorter development cycles the company applied that mentality across the organization every six weeks it kicks off a new customer experience improvement process based on the top three customer insights its managers have learned over the previous six weeks this creates an organizational muscle for change it also forces the company to actively and continuously examine customer feedback tcs let s move to your fourth competency employee engagement you re very careful to differentiate it from the employee experience tell us why temkin anything you re trying to do in a large organization is very difficult but it will be impossible if employees aren t engaged and by engaged we mean that they are committed to the success of the organization when people use the term employee experience they re often focused on making the work environment positive i m not saying this is a bad thing but it should not be an organization s ultimate goal with employees companies must create an environment where their employees commit their energy and passion to the success of the organization if you just focus on employee experience you can end up with entitled employees but they re not necessarily engaged they come to work because they believe there is an implicit deal that their employer is going to give them all this fun stuff and their part of the deal is merely showing up employee engagement is about having a richer implicit agreement with your employees the company will create an environment that allows you to be successful as an individual and satisfy your intrinsic needs for a sense of meaningfulness choice competence and progress in return the company expects employees to help the organization be successful overall this is a journey for most companies tcs which technologies should companies stay on top of in the years ahead because they are going to have a big impact on customer experience temkin i d start with something relatively simple text analytics and natural language processing nlp there is only so much you can learn from customers through their answers to multiple choice survey questions text analytics in combination with speech analytics provides the ability to gather insights about customers that come in unstructured ways such as from the call center and comments on surveys companies must create an environment where their employees commit their energy and passion to the success of the organization meanwhile voice as an interaction channel is growing whether it s the xfinity remote or the amazon echo or google home people want to interact with the world in a way that they are most comfortable and we are all trained on how to use a voice interface from an early age it s called talking companies need to use nlp to create interfaces that leverage voice but also figure out how to act based on what people say that gives rise to predictive analytics as companies gain more meaningful data from newly mined unstructured sources like voice and text and as they combine it with the growing amount of structured data their ability to understand and predict what customers need and to act on that is going to grow not only are the analytics technologies getting better companies are also getting better behavioral data whether it s from the digital footprints people leave or the customer data they collect predictive analytics models operate much more effectively when they can provide rich near term data rather than relying on a thin layer of historical data lastly the internet of things will give people more control and information to manage their lives this technology is going to advance much more quickly than it will be adopted by individuals consumers will adopt devices like the echo more quickly than other devices because coming home and asking for the weather is something people already ask of other people people tend to more quickly engage in behaviors that they re familiar with,the four core competencies of cx
50,ric merrifield is a thought leader and an independent consultant who has worked at companies such as microsoft and accenture over the last years in studying the impact of digital technologies on the customer experience and the it architectures of major companies his landmark harvard business review article the next revolution in productivity was a manifesto on how service oriented architectures were beginning to change the rules of digital competition based in seattle merrifield has published four articles in the harvard business review in all as well as a book rethink a business manifesto for cutting costs and boosting innovation pearson ft press his most recent writings are about how companies are using the internet of things technologies to reengineer customer experience in merrifield delivered a tedx2 talk about how technology will help improve the quality of life tcs how consequential do you feel the internet of things iot will be on the ways companies design customer experiences is iot bigger than crm in this regard is it bigger than smartphones ric merrifield i was heavily involved in crm in the early days back in the late s when you had to explain what customer relationship management meant at the time it was a revolutionary way for companies especially their salespeople to keep track of customers but even today crm remains very transactional in the sense that you track prospects you get an order and you support them after the sale with crm you collect data about customers at episodic touch points the times that your salespeople marketing department or call center interacted with them the reason is that they allow your company to get a much more extensive understanding of the end to end experience that the customer has with your product not just your experience with them in your marketing sales and service transactions you have richer context in terms of not only why they buy or don t buy but how happy they are throughout the course of using your product or service when they become unhappy with your offering you can respond to that long before they stop using it and as you collect all of this data it helps you to be smarter when you sell to the next customer crm systems to date really haven t gathered this type of information i think iot enabled customer experience management is going to be much bigger thancrm especially experiences that are enabled by iot technologies such as digital bracelets and wireless sensors as the repository of information grows and companies get clearer about their customers motivations for purchase and how they re using the products customer experience management will be much bigger than crm tcs over the last years you ve consulted with starbucks walt disney world nordstrom and other companies on their customer experience initiatives knowing that you can only say so much about them what larger lessons have you drawn from them for all companies that are managing or planning to launch major customer experience initiatives often a part of what many companies today are calling their digital transformation merrifield if you have information about their past experiences you can infer their preferences from those experiences for example are they focused on price or speed of service or whether they re looking for a certain product or service that they can t get anywhere else those insights will help you make better suggestions now that they re on your premises again once you detect that a customer has walked onto your premises whether it s a restaurant store theme park bank branch or other location if you have historical information about their past experiences with your firm what should you offer to them now the message to a price focused starbucks customer might be hey you can save on your vanilla latte today or if you re the customer looking for something different it might be hey we have a new pumpkin scone that you might like to try with your vanilla latte all to say you don t always have to lower your price in delivering a personalized message to a customer to increase the value that they get from you that is a key learning from customer experience data it s not always about giving people discounts or better deals it s about figuring out what they like and want so that the message resonates with them and you can both waste less time on messages that aren t going to make sense for them when you make an experience exclusive or in some way personalize it certain customers will even pay more until now there used to be a lot of guess work about this when somebody walked in your store your store clerks had to look at them and judge is this person here to spend money or just walk around and kill time do they want to grab a pair of bargain shoes and get out of here or do they want to have someone cater to them walk all the different aisles and show them what s new ten people who just walked in your door may have very different goals and unless you recognized the customer from a prior visit you had no clue about what he or she was there for now now with customer experience management data a department store should know the second you walk in that you bought a belt online last week from their site they might figure you re looking to buy a pair of slacks or shoes to go with it by the way the best retail organizations are paying great attention to group behaviors at different days of the week and times of the day at am they may get a very different mix of customers than what they get at lunch or at pm or pm and many of these retailers are putting products and displays on wheels so they can move them around at different times of day to appeal to different customers and customer behavior tcs many customer experience initiatives are monumental projects disney spent an estimated billion on its initiative at walt disney world other companies are spending in the hundreds of millions on their digital transformation initiatives does this mean a large company always needs to spend a huge amount to get something tangible in return for some iot enabled customer experience initiative merrifield not at all what doesn t always make headlines is that starbucks and disney both started with very practical business objectives and relatively modest goals for what they initially wanted to accomplish disney and starbucks had a couple of known problems that they wanted to solve the customer experience problem disney solved at disney world was that people didn t know that there are more days worth of things to do at disney world than a typical visit would cover so it ultimately started as an education project it created a my disney experience portal to help people learn why they should stay longer and the key to that was removing the obstacles to making them wait in lines so the magic band a digital bracelet became an enabling technology that allowed people to redeem the entitlements that they had created through the my disney experience portal it was never about increasing demand getting more people to go visit the park it was always about extending the duration of the stay of people planning to go starbucks goal of improving the store experience was similar reducing long lines it realized that sometimes the line is very long but either way many people don t want to wait in line the company wanted to allow customers to place an order and set their expectation about when it s going to be ready so that the cup of coffee doesn t get cold whether they re coming in for speed of service or a price or a starbucks product they can t get anywhere else starbucks didn t want them to wait in line to be served it turned out and it s no secret now that starbucks unlocked billions of dollars of revenue a year by using digital technologies to shorten the lines that it has a class of customer who it wasn t serving well those people who saw the long line of cars waiting to go through the drive through and then decided to go somewhere else or a long line in the store and walked back out again it was a much bigger problem than starbucks initially realized that is a really sound place to start if you know you ve got a problem or an opportunity to serve more customers than you re serving today or there s an education gap where they don t know something about your products and services then that is a great place to start you ve got to start with a practical business case that will deliver value but for most organizations investing hundreds of millions or billions of dollars isn t going to be the right place to start unless there is clear business value what value do you provide to customers that will keep them coming back for more tcs so even if it starts small what kinds of barriers should companies expect to face in making a meaningful improvement in its customer experience merrifield one is a lack of expertise internally for doing much of this work a team of technology people who have become great at managing servers networks help desks and so on may see the technologies of customer experience as one more new technology they can learn and master it s not so easy things like customer experience journey mapping are hard and different from what most people in companies do on a day to day basis it may look easy but it s not starbucks did most of its work in house that won t be the right decision for all companies having people who have done this before who understand why it s hard know how to not only define the scope but also how to develop the technology and test it roll it out and sustain it those are all pretty hard things to do stringing them all together successfully is really hard but it all needs to begin with a sound business case copycatting someone else is risky your business case must answer this question what value do you provide to customers that will keep them coming back for more tcs what about the role of top management in these initiatives are they that important to success merrifield yes and for more reasons than you might realize to set the right tone the ceo usually needs to be involved and not just because a company may have to write a big cheque customer experience initiatives such as the ones i ve been involved in can collapse under their own weight of popularity by this i mean people will want to take credit and be involved and it may turn out that they shouldn t be involved because it takes fresh thinking and can threaten people s empires some very powerful people may therefore get their feelings hurt and the ceo is just going to have to step in and say this is how we re going to deliver value in the future politics can kill these initiatives companies will need oversight and governance of these initiatives as they surface the politics of the organization it s why customer experience transformations are better done by a stand alone team as disney world did or by a separate entity such as a joint venture in either case they need to report to the ceo or head of the business making it a stand alone project will speed it up and reduce the risk of counterproductive slowdowns that happen when it s a functionally focused initiative run by people as a side job harvard business review the next revolution in productivity june accessed may youtube what technology can

as fast as newer smaller companies but i do not think that is a big handicap because they bring different strengths to the table that said they do need to move faster than they have historically but they have a base of capital and an ability to scale that the fledgling digital companies do not have yet for a big established company the question is how do we derive enough value from our heft how do we draw advantage from our size our experience and our relationships simultaneously how do we get a lot faster than we are tcs what are the biggest roadblocks for these companies once they decide to get faster ross the number one limiting factor is they have not fully become it enabled they have not automated to the extent they can they still have legacy processes that hold them back for a well managed company that has automated the new challenge is to make digital innovation happen all over the company these companies tradition is focused innovation often in an innovation unit in a digital world you want as many people innovating as you can you start distributing innovation to more people in more places at more levels of the organization in the course of doing their jobs they introduce innovations that lead to better outcomes a lot of the big old companies do not have a culture or governance process that would allow this without chaos tcs do digital businesses take a fundamentally faster approach to building–and improving as necessary–their operational backbone their mission critical systems ross frankly most digital start ups are not thinking about their operational backbone they are focused on building digital products and services and they build a digital services backbone for that purpose but as they grow they will struggle with scale completing transactions and back office processes the exceptions to that rule are companies like amazon facebook and google as they have grown they have built an operational backbone and it has facilitated their growth but even those companies have turned out a little different than they imagined when they started digitally born companies had an advantage because they did not have some of the older systems but they definitely have faced the challenge of speed–creating inefficiencies and challenges to building an operational platform first you are moving so fast you cannot fix things that did not fit you can create chaos in your systems and processes second you are incredibly profitable which makes it less important to introduce the efficiencies that your operational backbone offers when you are older and your growth slows you have a financial incentive to focus on efficiency and processes tcs you note the value of ongoing organizational redesign to a digital business what strategies can leaders of companies not born digital use to build team support for this idea ross the more you introduce an environment in which jobs are continually changing the better i think of usaa the fortune financial services company every time you talk to them people s jobs have changed what that starts to do is give people a much broader sense of what the company is trying to accomplish people are constantly learning and they are constantly challenged the idea is we are going to change tomorrow come in expecting to change that is the culture you want to foster–and it is not typical move people around a lot and then give them clear assignments and a clear idea of what the business needs to accomplish in an environment like that people do not worry about job security because this is the norm it is important to get accountability and empowerment right if you want to succeed in establishing a culture of change tcs that is a big leap of faith for employees to make it is it not how do the companies pull it off ross yes the hardest part is where to start the first few people you tap you pick people who are not risk averse and have energy for this kind of thing if you have had a stable environment this will be disarming for people you want senior executives saying we need to do this and asking what do we not know what do we not know about a given customer product or technology and how do we learn it that is the kind of culture companies will have to adopt it is what startups do without realizing it as people grow their jobs change and it is very natural you are trying to create excitement for identifying the next opportunity that will be hard start with a few people you have confidence in and it will grow as a rule companies are not good at this but you have to keep trying tcs in the digital business age the traditional divide and conquer approach to organizational design is being replaced with more horizontal teams where processes and roles flow across business units is this a nice to have or a must have for companies seeking speed ross it is a must have the thing that is causing the biggest problem is the need to integrate data you cannot just put a fancy front end on something and go mobility is so critical to digital if the data is not integrated people must insert themselves into what ought to be automated processes divide and conquer allows people to operate in silos each function or line of business figures out what must be done and divides up the necessary tasks to achieve that to integrate across those silos you rely on hierarchy push issues up and instructions and information will trickle back down with digital there is no time for that tcs what traits prove important for leaders of fast digital companies ross the single most important thing is they can shut out the noise they say what is our biggest issue today and let us get it resolved i am thinking about the ceo of lego in he recognized that their biggest problem was supply chain and he formed cross functional teams to solve it within a year it made a difference within three years it was really good and the company s performance had turned around these leaders understand that this is our biggest problem and solving that problem will facilitate immediate improvements and long term capabilities meanwhile other things will not get fixed the important thing is to get started to create capability that leads to more capabilities it is about being able to leverage multiple parts of your organization get on the road once you get going it is easy to pick up speed the way you are reducing the noise is focusing on the more fundamental problem and going after it tcs why is a digital services backbone–a technology infrastructure area where companies can develop digital offerings that may be highly valuable for only short periods of time key to speed ross the digital services backbone is what makes you fast it lets you try something and then say skip that i have a better idea it is not an upgrade to your operational backbone think about the app store model here there are many apps that are not any good the bad ones go away organically with your digital services backbone you really can say we are going to do this app or ui today and if we come up with a better one tomorrow the old one goes away lately we have been talking about the digital services backbone as a coral reef it builds and builds mostly through small organic additions little parts decay this digital services backbone lets you grow in unpredictable ways lego was the first one that described this to me lego s goal its vision is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow that means they want lego fans to collaborate with anyone who is building so lego decided we should let them design their own interface there are so many ways to engage lego fans and builders we want these ideas to grow organically tcs you have noted that a digital service backbone and the teams designing and using it will require new skills–some of which are not clear yet how do smart companies address this tough talent challenge ross they are really struggling with that what we have learned so far is that people are probably overreacting to the talent concern i would focus first on how we equip and develop the people we have it is absolutely true that the kind of talent we need is changing but we should not panic and hire people with fancy titles without a clear understanding of what we need them to do start by making your people more evidence based give them problems to solve and make them figure out what they need to solve them be sure you know what problem you are solving before you hire people to solve it it is easy to hire a chief digital officer for example but it is hard for that person to succeed if the company has not been explicit about its digital strategy and convinced everyone to get on board with the transformation start by looking at your operations are metrics clear are business rules clear can we test them it is about assigning new accountabilities break things up so people know what they are accountable for and have what they need to pull it off if you start at the bottom of the company it is very doable we are seeing some companies that have got their heads around this they are dividing an end to end process into services they look for constant improvements as a result the talent issue is a bit of a red herring we have not designed our companies to make the most of talent and develop it tcs that sounds like it will require big changes in the hiring process are companies capable of doing it ross it is very addressable only a few people have to really understand this for example google talks about people operations not hr in a lot of the startups you have a manager and a coach those kinds of things are being adopted i imagine it moves into recruiting pretty quickly how long will it take and how good at it will companies get good question tcs are many companies still too focused on operational backbone to the detriment of their digital services backbone ross a lot of companies talk about we built our platform for supply chain but now we have to have a platform for manufacturing and they go on and on with these platforms those platforms can add value to a company but they lead to incremental improvements to the operational backbone which only offers efficiency not innovation you do not help the company grow if you focus only on your operational backbone because you grow through innovation there is a risk of just doing more of what you are good at it will generate diminishing returns it must be complimented by a digital services backbone that has been a real issue for big companies that like control and order it is not that they will not get value but it does not take them into the digital economy,increasing speed in the digital era interview with jeanne ross
52,michael a cusumano1 is a professor at the massachusetts institute of technology s sloan school of management in cambridge massachusetts for more than years he has conducted research and taught classes on software company strategy product development and entrepreneurship as well as early in his career manufacturing and product development methods in the automobile and consumer electronics industries he has published books and more than articles and columns on these topics his latest book strategy rules five timeless lessons from bill gates andy grove and steve jobs published with david yoffie in has been translated into languages and received widespread media acclaim he has also lectured and consulted to nearly organizations around the world in the last two years professor cusumano had been on leave from mit and served as vp and dean at the tokyo university of science because of his extensive studies over the last four decades on software development product development manufacturing and more recently software business strategy he possesses unique insights on technology and technology based business strategy and product development tcs your research on lean management practices dates back more than years can you tell us about the genesis of lean thinking michael cusumano as part of my doctoral thesis on the japanese automobile industry and eventually for a book i published the japanese automobile industry technology and management at nissan and tokyo harvard university press i analyzed the toyota production system in the 1980s i studied their productivity at the company level units outputs per company as well as value added and i adjusted for things such as labor hours capital investment and capacity utilization toyota was producing vehicles with half the number of people used by the american companies but with the same amount of capital equipment that was interesting so what was lean at that time was the number of people then a student of mine john krafcik who was working on his master s thesis here at the mit sloan school studied the japanese production system at a more abstract level john took this thinking to the assembly plant level what was productivity like there what degree of automation did they have in the assembly plants what management practices did they use a number of us here at mit worked on this research and debated what was the right term to describe these management practices we saw at toyota john came up with the term lean today he is ceo of google s automobile self driving subsidiary waymo at that time john published a companion article to mine on japanese manufacturing innovations in the mit sloan management review called the triumph of lean 2that started the whole thing since then lean has been applied to everything under the sun but the original idea was doing roughly the same amount of work in terms of having the same number of outputs or products with much leaner staff a book that came out in the machine that changed the world3 by the three co directors at the time of mit s international motor vehicle program james womack daniel jones and daniel roos documented that the japanese car makers were assembling cars in less than half the time the u s manufacturers were hours vs hours tcs by the mid 1990s your research began focusing on product development in the automotive sector tell us more about that cusumano one of my doctoral students at the time kentaro nobeoka and i studied automotive product development an earlier study by two of our colleagues kim clark and takahiro fujimoto who published the research in their book product development performance found u s automobile companies were generally taking to months to develop a new vehicle the japanese were pretty close to a month schedule and doing it with about two thirds the engineering hours but we had identified a problem in our research in the mid 1990s the japanese automakers had become in many ways too lean they weren t sharing much technology across projects within the same company their heavyweight projects might appear lean if you look at them individually but if you look at a company with a portfolio of products the japanese heavyweight project management teams were too self contained they weren t sharing very much so it was actually becoming expensive for them to develop new automobiles nobeoka and i wrote more about that in our book4 thinking beyond lean tcs so then you shifted your research on automotive manufacturing and product development to the software industry tell us more about that cusumano i actually shifted my major research emphasis to software engineering even before i published my first book in on the japanese automobile industry large scale software development became my main focus from when i wrote my doctoral thesis at harvard in the early 1980s it was clear to me that the next future challenge for japanese companies would be writing software in a post doctoral project i did at harvard business school from to half of my time i spent studying consumer electronic projects with a harvard professor richard rosenbloom and the other half i spent studying japanese software factories i e largely how the big japanese computer manufacturers such as fujitsu nec and hitachi developed their software then i published a book in called japan s software factories on who started the factory idea how they evolved and so on the japanese essentially copied how u s computer manufacturers like ibm ran their own software development centers in the 1970s and 1980s because the japanese companies were mostly making ibm mainframe compatible hardware and software i got interested in the question of whether japanese companies could apply the expertise they had accumulated in manufacturing and engineering quality control project management and so on to large scale industrial software i found most were taking ibm approaches to software development there was nothing lean about it by the way it was almost the complete opposite of lean or what we would today call agile tcs so it was true waterfall approaches to software development cusumano it was very waterfall however japanese software developers were good at quality but they didn t have a good business model for making money from the software itself they were essentially selling hardware like ibm had done for many years building operating systems and some applications but they didn t really know how to make money from software after this study came out in from being very interested in software and the new personal computers i decided to follow the money as i like to say who was actually making money from software it was microsoft yet nothing had really been written about how microsoft developed software in or so i suggested to an ibm person stan smith who was doing a master s thesis under me at mit that he write his thesis comparing mainframe and pc software development so he compared ibm and fujitsu with microsoft and lotus and got an interview at microsoft and i went with him there when i heard the story of how microsoft was developing software i immediately knew this was very very different from the waterfall world of software development that i had learned almost all the principles of agile development microsoft was doing back then they just didn t call it that at the time so i immediately pitched a book to microsoft which eventually had to be approved by bill gates which he did i co authored it with a professor of computer science richard selby because stan went back to ibm cusumano and selby published the book microsoft secrets in tcs so what did you learn about the ways that microsoft developed software in the 1990s cusumano since this interview is about lean and agile management approaches i think you ll find this interesting almost all the principles of agile development microsoft was doing back then they just didn t call it that at the time they did certain things differently but the basic tenets of daily builds continuous integration testing working around small chunks of code features small feature teams microsoft developers were all doing those things i must note that the company wasn t doing this in all of their product groups but they were doing it in their best groups excel and word among them the excel group pushed these techniques the furthest eventually all development groups in microsoft adopted these practices with some variations we never called it lean but they thought of themselves that way especially when they compared themselves to ibm tcs so now we circle back to agile development when you look at your research over the last plus years starting with manufacturing and product development processes in the auto industry and then moving to software development and software business strategy more recently are there any principles in developing and making cars that transcend to software cusumano at a higher level of principles there are a half dozen points that i make the most critical one is about waterfall s sequential approach to development vs doing things concurrently or in parallel in both cases when you do things sequentially it s going to take a longer time so why was gm s product development cycle months back then it was because of the way they scheduled things they had certain bottlenecks and couldn t do certain things in parallel because they had never tried to do them in parallel when we looked at how the japanese auto companies got product development down to months they were doing a whole bunch of things in parallel for example they were starting their manufacturing preparations and die manufacturing almost concurrently they were sharing information with the different teams as soon as they could figure out the dimensions of a car door the die guys would start working they didn t wait until the whole car was designed so they started overlapping a lot of those phases if you look at waterfall vs agile lean methods or what selby and i called the synchronize and stabilize approach which is the name we used in the book about microsoft the company was doing a lot of things in parallel they would start writing code before they had a complete specification sometimes they never got a complete spec they would start integration testing as early as possible they didn t wait to test a system until the end another thing we found was that there could be a lot of wasted effort if you have to redo a lot of work if you built a prototype of a software product and showed it to customers early you could eliminate a lot of those changes later on even if you were doing a lot of what seemed to be re work or fixing bugs early by throwing code into integration tests early you were still saving yourself a lot of time in the end firms that did early prototype driven development and not just throw away prototypes but working prototypes and then did small incremental but frequent builds and continuous design and coding reviews ended up with higher productivity and better software quality than software developed through waterfall ish approaches tcs so the last thing we come to is the topic of building software for internet applications you ve written about this too starting years ago comparing how one of the early web browser companies netscape and microsoft competed against each other in the early days of the web cusumano when netscape came to market with one of the first internet browsers navigator they had basically copied some of microsoft s practices they were doing daily builds for example but one of the things that was very different with netscape is that they weren t printing software on disks and putting disks in boxes and shipping boxes to stores and that kind of thing they weren t delivering software that way they also weren t necessarily delivering software to pc manufacturers that s the way that microsoft delivered software that slowed the cycle netscape was just posting new versions of navigator on its website and you downloaded it so we saw at netscape that they would have new releases every week or every other week that was a completely different way of developing and releasing software in microsoft those would all be internal releases in netscape they were public releases microsoft came up with its own browser explorer but the first couple of versions weren t very good but by version they had caught up and netscape got bogged down netscape had added all these features around the browser and they were not as disciplined as microsoft so eventually the daily builds wouldn t work they had around million lines of spaghetti code those are the phrases netscape engineers used internally so netscape did things too fast and they were not very disciplined at testing we think microsoft won the browser wars because they actually had a better browser by the time you got to version or and then of course netscape sold itself to aol although the code lives on in firefox tcs and of course since those early web days of browser wars we re seeing whole industries being upended by the internet media retailing banking the taxi and hotel industries and many more what do you think that means for the way companies develop software and whole internet based businesses that of course require software cusumano i must admit that i don t know much about how these companies develop software these days but i don t see software development as a problem for them whereas years ago software development was a huge problem the bigger problem now seems to be their strategy or business model perhaps software development is much less of a problem today because people have more knowledge of what good practices are and that they ve largely abandoned although not completely the old waterfall style they have become much more careful about how and when they use the waterfall and are more eclectic in methods in addition a lot of big companies today have outsourced their software development that s another reason why it s not a problem these companies may have some lean in house staffs but outside specialists are building a lot of their software although that might be different for defense companies or large banks or small internet startups in general once companies stopped trying to force square pegs into round holes or force a methodology that might work for space shuttle software but is not necessary for a smartphone app then software development got a lot easier for a lot

53,steve blank has been at the epicenter of the lean startup movement since he ignited it in with his book the four steps to the epiphany a silicon valley entrepreneur for years who founded or was involved in the launch of eight technology startups both successes and failures blank left that world in to teach and consult on startups today blank s lean launchpad approach which he teaches at stanford university the university of california berkeley and columbia university is taught at more than universities worldwide what s more lean startup methods have been embraced by a number of government and scientific organizations blank s stanford class became the curriculum for the national science foundation innovation corps in since that time over a thousand scientists and engineers have taken the course to help commercialize their ideas blank also co created the hacking for defense and hacking for diplomacy programs which use lean startup methods to address critical national security problems you can read his extensive writings at the turn of the century one of blank s students was eric ries who launched two companies that blank had funded the first practitioner of blank s lean startup method ries took the concept mainstream after publishing two books the lean startup and the startup way from his silicon valley outpost blank has continued to publish books about lean startup methods as well including the bestselling startup owner s manual co authored with bob dorf in addition blank has been an author or co author of eight harvard business review articles including a may cover article why the lean start up changes everything and an article in hbr s november–december print edition when founders go too far he recently talked about his lean startup principles the reasons why big established companies and government agencies need to adopt them and the challenges they ve had in trying to do so tcs your ideas around the lean startup have jumped the tracks from the startup world to the big company world and to the government but before you talk about how large organizations are using them take us back to the evolution of the ideas steve blank it started just from a very personal basis i was a serial entrepreneur i did eight startups in years and retired in when you re a practitioner you don t have time to think about big picture stuff you just do what you are told if you re lucky and good you get to do it again when i retired i started thinking about the innovation of entrepreneurship it struck me that in the 20th century startup investors treated startups like they were nothing more than smaller versions of large companies it was a big idea what startup investors essentially said was if big companies are doing business plans we want a plan big companies do five year forecasts so obviously before we invest we need to see the forecast and big companies hire sales marketing and business development people on day that s what we want you the startup to do and big companies build their products with waterfall engineering which is a serial process that specifies all the features and then works for the next year or two to delivering them for release startups are not smaller versions of large companies large companies are large because they execute a known business model but it wasn t until i retired and started thinking about this that i realized it was wrong big time startups are not smaller versions of large companies large companies are large because they execute a known business model a known business model is of what large companies do it s gee we know our channel we know our customers we know our pricing we know our competitors we know lots of stuff and most of this stuff is continuing to fill the pipeline with product line extensions and new features painting it blue or whatever that is a known business model by contrast startups have very few things that are known startups are searching for a business model yet business schools have built years of tools and techniques for executing known business models of existing companies remember business schools were designed to graduate people with degrees in business administration therefore we were building tools to help those administrators but no one had consciously said that perhaps we need a management toolset in a management stack for innovators it didn t exist the language barely existed so i started reading all the literature about innovation the irony here was that very little literature existed about startups there was literature about corporate innovation rita mcgrath stuff clayton christensen stuff and so on but i felt it was about innovation in the context of environment that was primarily focused on execution to make a long story short i wrote the four steps to the epiphany that was the first time anyone ever described the difference between search startups and execution existing companies that kicked off the lean startup movement by describing one of the three components of lean the customer development process i said a startup has no facts about real customers when the people in that startup stay inside their building therefore they need to get the heck outside then one of my students eric ries said steve you grew up in the 20th century with waterfall engineering where products were built serially but startups are now using something called agile engineering where they re building the products iteratively and incrementally that is a perfect fit for customer development so why don t we combine customer development and agile engineering then i ran into someone named alexander osterwalder who had figured out how to map a page business plans into a single diagram called the business model canvas so i adopted osterwalder s canvas as a living scorecard for first articulating the hypotheses a startup needs to test and then to keep track of what they learned using my customer development process as well as to test the minimal viable products we were building using eric s agile engineering method those three components business model design customer development and agile engineering became the lean startup one key idea of this lean method was this notion that we re learning new things as we talk to customers and test minimum viable products and as we learn we give startups permission to make substantive changes to their business model these changes are called a pivot it s hard to remember but in the old days and this still happens in corporations once your plan is blessed any deviation is considered a failure instead of as learning geez what were we thinking tcs so the venture capitalists in silicon valley in the 1980s and 90s got nervous if the founders changed their initial business model blank yeah and when that happened they fired the founders any failure was treated as a failure of the individuals not a failure of the initial hypothesis or assumptions that s a huge idea huge their belief was there can be nothing wrong with the plan i funded it it must be an execution problem by the way it wasn t that the founders were always right but there was no notion that they needed to be testing and exploring their company s hypotheses about customers about features wanted about pricing channel etc … the other problem was that we started staffing and building a burn rate per the business plan i remember being in companies where the only thing that went according to plan was our burn rate you kind of go i don t think this is right even though you got three quarters of the plan correct so i said what s wrong with this movie tcs when you stopped launching companies in venture capital was abundant so perhaps the vcs were not too worried about many of their portfolio companies failing as long as they had a few winners that more than made up for the losers blank during the last dot com boom around we didn t need any of this lean startup stuff because we had infinite cash post dot com crash people were being pretty judicious about time and resources and lean made all the sense in the world the irony is that now with funds like sequoia and even more so like softbank having huge funds makes up for everything their approach is it doesn t matter i ll buy my way in the irony is that the need for lean has now moved from startups which had to be judicious with cash to established corporations which are actually much more threatened than startups the real surprise for me is that some startups now have more capital than large corporations herein lies the opportunity of using lean startup approaches in corporations big companies that survive are no longer just delivering what mckinsey called horizon one innovation incremental features colors supply chain efficiencies and so on and horizon two innovation satisfying the needs of existing customers with new products the ones that are going to stay in business are now acting like startups by delivering what mckinsey years ago called the third horizon of innovation i e disruption apple the computer company getting into music amazon the ecommerce company buying whole foods large corporations have great managers dealing with horizon one and two types of innovation the problem is they are facing continuous disruption they have horizon three problems now but the wrong leadership to deal with them if you got your mba more than three years ago everything you know about innovation is obsolete for the first time in the history of corporations established companies are not setting the rules the rules are changing rapidly that s why you see all this m a activity and people just trying to figure out what the new rules are there is probably more innovation and creative disruption right now of corporations since maybe in the gilded age in the u s the late 1800s tcs so largely speaking how have large companies reacted to the lean startup ideas since you started publishing them blank between my work and eric ries work who in his book wrote about their application at ge and procter gamble there has been recognition and adoption at various levels but it s hard to turn super tankers remember large corporations can innovate not only by using lean methodologies to build internal innovation they can also buy companies tcs what are the biggest challenges large companies face in adopting lean startup approaches blank it s the other way around the issue is not about adoption of lean the issue is about dealing with continuous disruption lean is just a tool in a tool set it is not the answer it is a component of this how do i change the engines of the plane while it s in flight am i reconfiguring the product line am i going digital am i changing channels am i reinventing the company and am i willing to bet my job and is my strategy aligned with my investors and my board tcs so what five years after harvard business review published your article on the lean startup are big companies doing enough to make their ventures lean blank i keep telling hbr they ought to be writing the article why the lean startup changed nothing he laughs the article mostly resulted in innovation theater a set of activities typically like incubators and accelerators inside a company that generate great coffee cups posters and lanyards and almost nothing else my test for their effectiveness is this did it move the top or bottom line what i often get back is let me show you our dogs at work policy what i ve learned is that companies don t just need to build a lean startup process they need to build an end to end innovation pipeline that has a funnel on the left and deliverables on the right if you don t know the ratio of funnel ideas to deliverables you re going to get it wrong the big mistake is confusing activities with deliverables when i ask them about deliverables the answer for some of them or more is they have none yet you re not going to believe this but it turns out the people who are doing it right is the u s government the approach plays out slightly differently for government agencies but because the government is being disrupted the consequences are even greater than they are for companies macy s can go out of business in the u s and the country will still go on we can t afford to have part of our defense department go out of business from being disrupted they get it they understand it their disruption is pretty clear in the 20th century the country was essentially facing a single adversary now you need a scorecard they need to scale their innovations to today s much higher number of adversaries they now realize the answer is not only tech which is machine learning and robotics and whatever but also innovation processes that are radically different than the way they ve been building requirements and acquiring products and services the defense department has adopted not just lean but this notion of an innovation pipeline incredibly fast the national security strategy written by the secretary of defense is probably one of the most important innovation documents so far of the 21st century it said organize for innovation the department s management structure and processes are not written in stone they are a means to an end–empowering the warfighter with the knowledge equipment and support systems to fight and win department leaders will adapt their organizational structures to best support the joint force if current structures hinder substantial increases in lethality or performance it is expected that service secretaries and agency heads will consolidate eliminate or restructure as needed the department s leadership is committed to changes in authorities granting of waivers and securing external support for streamlining processes and

54,for years tom davenport has been one of the most influential advisors globally on the business impact and application of information technology he made the topic of big data and analytics a boardroom issue with his groundbreaking harvard business review article competing on analytics and a book2 of the same name in davenport and julia kirby published a book on ai only humans need apply winners and losers in the age of smart machines3 since the late 1980s he has conducted research and published dozens of harvard business review articles and books many of which have been bestsellers davenport is a professor at babson college near boston a fellow of the mit initiative on the digital economy a co founder of the international institute for analytics and a senior advisor to deloitte s analytics practice tcs you more than anyone else made executives aware of the opportunities of big data and analytics more than years ago with your harvard business review article and the book that followed now the market s attention seems to have shifted away from analytics to artificial intelligence since both depend on digital data there must be a big connection between the two one that may be getting lost in the marketplace how would you describe that connection davenport the fact that we have so much digital data today in some domains a massive amount means ai can succeed now in areas in which it was struggling one example is image and facial recognition yes i realize that recognizing cat photos on the internet is not one of humankind s greatest advances laughs but seriously the distinction between big data and analytics and ai is a little bit artificial because so much of ai is based on big data and analytics it makes big data and analytics a more autonomous and in some cases a more sophisticated and complex form of analytics some forms of ai are more semantics based in their orientation in trying to understand human language and so on but the largest activity in ai and the most sophisticated is machine learning its new forms like deep learning are among the biggest changes in the current round of ai and it is statistical in nature the largest activity in ai and the most sophisticated is machine learning you need a lot of data and statistical algorithms to analyze this data no matter which of the four areas of analytics i ve written about descriptive predictive prescriptive and automated but with ai you get industrial scale analytics by automating the analysis tcs so does that mean you d advise companies that haven t mastered big data and analytics not to go right to mastering ai davenport that s right any company that would skip analytics and go straight to ai is not likely to be successful with ai i was talking recently with an asian insurance company which is interested in automating some aspects of their underwriting but the problem is the business unit that proposed this doesn t use analytics to any great extent for underwriting they continue to rely on the judgment and experience of their people who make decisions on business insurance i think it will be very difficult to make that jump without having done the analytics and accumulating the data you need for the analytics any company that would skip analytics and go straight to ai is not likely to be successful with ai tcs in your book last year you talked about automation vs augmentation talk to us briefly about each type of usage and are most companies automation over augmentation and if so why davenport automation of course is the replacement of human workers by machines augmentation is when machines and people work together alongside each other perhaps because i am a human i am partial to augmentation my book with julia kirby lays out five approaches to augmentation three that involve humans working closely with smart machines and two that involve humans prospering by avoiding machines my research since the book suggests that a great majority of companies that are implementing ai are pursuing augmentation there has been very little job loss thus far i am sure there will be some jobs lost to ai in the future but i think they will be in lower numbers and it will take longer for the jobs to go away than most other observers tcs do you believe every industry has big opportunities from cognitive technologies and which ones do you believe have some of the biggest opportunities davenport the opportunities are there for every industry but for sure some will move slower than others it will be the same ones that moved more slowly with analytics the availability of data is the key gating factor b2b companies for example just don t tend to have as much data as b2c companies at least not customer data in the example i mentioned earlier business insurance will move more slowly with ai than personal lines any industry where you don t have much data is going to be challenged by doing really sophisticated work in this area also smaller businesses are moving much more slowly than big businesses with ai as they have with other technologies the nature of what a company sells also will determine whether it moves quickly or slowly those offering a purely digital product are going to explore ai much faster banking is basically all digital now and rapid adoption of robo advice is evidence of that ai has also been pretty pervasive in asset management and trading for a while and getting more so in medicine digital specialties like radiology and pathology are likely to be the first to embrace ai medical activities that involve a lot of face to face contact with patients or physical manipulation of patients will probably proceed more slowly the media industry and especially online media such as facebook and google that were born digital have huge opportunities with ai google and facebook are among the world leaders in using ai and yet they are still finding their way about just how automated they can be facebook has had some false starts in terms of not being able to easily identify fake news vs real news and so it had to back away a little bit it also wasn t able to fully use automated approaches to identify offensive images so it has a large number of people still doing that but they re trying ai all over the place for the most part they have been quite successful at automating key aspects of figuring out what ads to run on what sites that s been very lucrative for both google and facebook tcs what jobs do you believe are at greatest risk in companies because of ai davenport the way i think about it is this if you re doing something that is the same as what everyone else does you will have two problems the first is someone can probably identify the structure of your job and if they can identify the structure they can probably write some code to automate it the second problem is that if you have a job that many other people are doing there is a lot of economic incentive to go to the trouble of automating it if you have a niche job that few people do why would anybody bother automating it my favorite example of this comes from a newspaper story i read a couple of years ago it talked about a person who connects buyers and sellers of dunkin donuts franchises a u s restaurant chain he makes an incredible living and drives around in a rolls royce and connecting buyers and sellers is something that machines do all the time but i think that is such a niche that nobody would view it as economical to automate tcs should companies that invest or plan to invest heavily in ai be transparent with employees about what they are doing and why they are doing it should they address their worry about jobs davenport in first place cutting jobs through automation is generally not a good strategy it s a race to the bottom in that your costs will go down but you should expect competitors will do the same thing that means everybody s margins in your industry will drop and it will be harder to innovate unless you already make a highly commoditized product it will be a race to the bottom we have to increase our productivity which in the u s has been growing very slowly or even falling in what s more in the transition from humans doing the work to computers doing the work you need a lot of help from the people doing the work you re far more likely to get that help if you give them some assurances that they will be able to keep their jobs i think we have to get some economic benefit from all of this technology we have to increase our productivity which in the u s has been growing very slowly or even falling in to boost productivity companies produce more with less cost but the best way to achieve that is through attrition not through layoffs implementing ai is going to be a slow process anyway so you might as well get some loyalty from your employees and say you re only going to reduce jobs through attrition tcs do you come across companies that are thinking carefully about how these smart machines will affect employee jobs and how employees might begin to prepare for the transition davenport it s very early days for that but general electric has started to do it they ve created these personas of the types of jobs that are likely to be threatened new types of jobs that will be created and the jobs that will be largely augmented by machines that was one of the topics they addressed at a big strategy meeting recently in boston the key for thought leaders will be in coming up with new ideas rather than describing numbers about old ideas but i would still say it s pretty early for that kind of conversation it should be happening more frequently but it s not it should be happening more for several reasons in addition to not creating a workforce where fear of automation takes over the fact is it will take a while to train people on the new skills they ll need to work effectively alongside the machines this is the augmentation model for ai now these people may hold back their knowledge and their support if they are worried that they are going to lose their jobs so for a variety of reasons it makes sense to be upfront and start that early tcs do you think thought leaders soon will be facing competition from ai davenport well not the good ones laughs but i do think certain aspects of what professional services firms have referred to as thought leadership could well be at least partially automated for example many of them do surveys you could easily imagine systems that automatically generated text about the results of those surveys just like you have systems that automatically generate write ups of baseball games and company earnings reports now i don t think there is any application available for this yet for surveys but if and when there are i think they might be able to do a better job at writing about the numbers than a human could for example an ai writing application could make comparisons to other surveys and provide analysis that a human might not notice because he or she might get bored poring over survey numbers this kind of writing application has worked quite well at the associated press and other organizations that have been automating the writing of numbers driven reports in fact several companies have automated the writing of monthly investment reports and suspicious activity reports for money laundering in banking writing about numbers is increasingly going to be automated the key for thought leaders will be in coming up with new ideas rather than describing numbers about old ideas harvard business review competing on analytics january accessed august at competing on analytics the new science of winning at amazon com only humans need apply winners and losers in the age

55,every company today must digitally transform itself to be ready for industry a business world in which orders come to a company through customers smartphones and products are delivered in digital form to their digital devices think banking media software travel booking and more and even if the products aren t fully digital the service that s delivered is likely to be transacted and consumed with a lot of digital help think amazon s cashier less grocery stores or the visitors to walt disney world in florida wearing magic band digital bracelets however to transform themselves for a digital world and give customers a personalized digital experience companies must recognize the importance of digital data unfortunately digital data is the overlooked element of digital transformation akin to electricity in an industrial economy or oil in the automotive sector without data that can be digitized processed in volume dissected to produce new insights about the business and acted upon quickly a company cannot digitally transform itself it needs such data and the ability to use it to constantly monitor its performance for customers the state of its operations and its financial condition for the board without superior capabilities in managing digital data that company can t be responsive enough to customers it won t be able to personalize and deliver promotions at the right shopping moment to a shopper s smartphone it won t have an up to the minute picture of the state of its supply chain and customer performance and it won t be able to build superb financial systems that can identify revenue leakage fraud and other problems that can turn into audit and thus boardroom and regulatory issues rapidly to put it simply digital data is the dna that guides digital transformation it is why such data has become a board level matter companies that can gather process analyze and use the digital data that s coursing through their digital systems are gaining three huge advantages in the marketplace they can generate new revenue faster recognizing new customer opportunities and evolving new business models with greater agility they are more profitable because they have automated previously manual data processes through artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml lowering costs and improving revenue recognition while speeding the close they can process more digital data thereby driving more data based business strategies and enabling them to take calculated growth risks however many companies struggle to maximize the value of the increasingly large volumes of digital data they collect this is understandable one reason is that the amount of digital data that companies now collect is huge and growing an astonishing of the world s digital data was created in just the last two years nearly seven decades after the first computers began showing up in offices and the volume of digital data is only going to grow exponentially due to smartphones born in and now becoming ubiquitous the internet of things billions of sensors attached to everything from coffee parts to aircraft engines and ever more digital devices the inability to manage this explosion of digital data is why cloud computing revenue is growing rapidly at such companies as amazon microsoft and google in our view it shows that most large companies understand they can t afford the enormous amounts of processing power required to process and secure all that data in their own data centers those cloud companies were part of a billion public cloud market last year according to gartner these essentially are data utilities huge computing factories that collect secure process and provide tools to analyze and transmit digital data to organizations that need it the digital transformation of business necessary now for competitive advantage and survival demands exceptional data management capabilities however right now these capabilities are not widespread in the marketplace lagging digital data practicesmost big companies recognize that they re only fair or worse at managing their digital data in a gartner survey of nearly organizations around the world rated themselves average or below average in using and analyzing their digital data only would categorize their data maturity at the highest level transformational where data is available to all departments and business units not sequestered inside them and analytics practices and tools and insights are shared liberally around a company enabling the organization to grow while improving internal processes especially financial ones digital data deficiencies can be seen in four areas data collection digitally immature organizations lack a coherent data inventory or data blueprint meaning they aren t fully cognizant of what data they possess although organizations capture huge volumes of digital data in multiple channels about virtually every business process their products and customer interactions many companies have no comprehensive catalog of the data or its state every organization has a hierarchy of business processes that rely on data but many lack an overview of how the datasets they have relate to each of these processes what s more they often don t know how the data relates to how well the company s marketing sales r d distribution and other key business processes are performing for example they don t know what data is most important to identifying a new customer or convincing that customer to buy when they look at where they are collecting data these companies often discover they don t have nearly the data they need for a superior customer service experience or for demand generation they typically find they have data siloes departments that don t share critical data especially about customers missing internal data information they never thought of collecting before often because of the cost or impossibility of collecting it often images and voice and missing external data especially from business partners such as suppliers wholesalers and retailers processing data when the big data trend erupted companies sought to take advantage they collected data from diverse sources internally and externally it came from partners public sources social media and sensors in connected devices they availed themselves of falling storage costs new database technologies and ever expanding and accessible computing resources and power including the cloud but many underestimated how much data they d have to process the result is that the computational tasks in numerous large companies require enormous computing power and data center management skills that even the largest it shops don t have that s why there s a huge public cloud computing business that is growing rapidly and some companies are investigating the potential of high performance and quantum computing analyzing data even if a company can collect and process all the digital data it must if it can t analyze it ferreting out the trends and other insights that result in more sales higher profits more efficient manufacturing and distribution and so on the business will suffer and although many companies have pockets of excellence in analyzing their data and often have achieved some benefits those impacts frequently are limited to those functions that invested in analytics skills and technologies these groups developed ways of structuring and analyzing data that were tailored to their teams specific uses such as marketing but they have limited applicability to other functions extending the benefits of data widely across organizations is critical to improving every business operation and identifying growth opportunities it s key to becoming more agile and accelerating decision making making rapid decisions and changes after generating insights on digital data recent technology advances such as ai and cloud computing present new opportunities to increase roi improve business processes and delight customers ai enables fast decision making cloud computing provides for the efficient use of computing resources and it facilitates the ability to disseminate data based insights whether customer focused or internal across an organization companies that don t take advantage of on demand scalability to manage data within and outside the enterprise and use plug and play facilities for intelligent applications services solutions and tools soon will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage if they are not already let s now look at how best practice companies manage their digital data three steps to leveraging datafrom our work with dozens of large companies around the world in improving their digital data management capabilities we have found three steps to becoming proficient at leveraging such data assess the current state by benchmarking the company s digital intelligence its capabilities in gathering processing analyzing and acting on data it should also cover which technologies are currently in use including whether cloud based systems are deployed people and processes should also be evaluated to determine which skills and positions in the organization are enabling the use of analytics the processes being used to manage them and where there may be gaps a candid assessment will identify the extent to which leaders embrace the importance of using data to identify strategic opportunities and insights about the business its competitors and customers leaders who aren t aware of the potential benefits of leveraging digital data can learn examples of successful analytics use within the company information about competitors activities or evidence of what stronger capabilities could mean for the business can help make the case determine where the company should go and map out how to build the capabilities required to get there the plan should include the technologies that will be used to inform decisions and execute processes it should factor in the opportunities afforded by cloud computing including how the company will share data analytics resources internally here the task is to determine a target state = key goals for this step include identifying how data will help innovation and ways to introduce automation in the company s data management and decision making questions to be answered include which sources currently are in use what will be needed in the optimal state internally sources can include customer records from activities in physical and digital channels such as smartphones and websites externally data may be retrieved from partners about their activities with shared customers and from social media including consumer sentiment data new data may come from sources such as internet of things iot sensors other sources such as public data from government databases may also be valuable point the company s analytics instruments at the strongest opportunities for increasing revenue improving profitability and mitigating risk establishing consistent models for collecting formatting storing and analyzing data will enable a company to reuse its data in different parts of the organization customer data can be useful across marketing sales finance and supply chain management using the tools of data analysis is also crucial a combination of technologies enables companies to process and analyze more data more effectively this leads to better decisions finally the company must acquire analytics skills as well as the skills to create a data driven culture fueled by analytics that involves creating an immersive analytics environment in which the data trends are brought to life through information visualization visual analytics virtual and augmented reality and intuitive user interfaces the key to digital data usage is establishing the means for business experts to collaborate with the data and analytics experts as with every major change in business culture the transformation requires leadership from the very top of an organization i e the board of directors what organizations get when they master their datathe practices we ve described have top and bottom line outcomes managing the collection processing analysis and usage of digital data in superior ways leads to superior operational and financial performance of three types increased revenue greater profitability and lower risk let s look at each one more revenuesuperior management of digital data is proving time and again to boost companies top line examples are numerous to increase revenue and improve profitability monsanto the billion agricultural and biotech company launched a cloud analytics platform it calls science scale the platform enables the company s data experts and scientists to collaborate accelerating the development of analytics driven decision models according to monsanto cio james swanson the company estimates it gained million in top line u s revenue and saved million in operating costs because the platform enables scientific work to be completed in hours rather than months abb a billion industrial firm that services power plants and automates industrial processes credits its abb ability platform of services with driving an increase in orders for its software and services in the platform collects real time data analyzes and monitors conditions at factories oil wells and power plants to reduce operating costs and improve safety and maintenance the company estimates the platform has the potential to generate billion in annual sales using analytics ai and other intelligent technologies such companies can now gain insights about the health of their business processes and the performance of products in the field they can use these insights to evaluate and pursue opportunities to monetize data by selling it to organizations that would benefit from it above all the meaning they derive from data can lead to growth improved profitability and stronger risk management capabilities insights from digital data can shed light on customer wants and needs permitting a company to offer improved customer experiences and increase sales these insights lead to the identification of opportunities for growth and more profitable business models as abb s experience illustrates speed to insight enabled by cloud based analytics services is crucial for organizations to reap the benefits of digital data at volume monsanto s science scale platform has created savings and generated revenues by accelerating data analysis higher profitabilitydigital data gives firms new avenues for operational improvements both back office and customer facing and better informed investments that can improve profitability for example a firm can use iot sensors in its facilities to capture data on its energy usage then analyze temperatures occupancy levels and other conditions to optimize energy consumption and reduce operating costs growing operating margins siemens the billion global energy engineering and manufacturing giant recently launched a new business using intelligent sensors and software to analyze u s railroad data the insights it derived helped railroad operators anticipate errors and boost performance a train that isn t operating isn t generating either revenue or profit but it s still consuming resources the system an internet of trains is being deployed by railroads in multiple countries 9by using data from ecosystems partners a company can create valuable insights that it can use or sell to others monsanto s climate corporation unit has established a hub for agricultural technology firms to sell apps to farmers they use them to access multiple data streams and track their operations from a variety of viewpoints with insights from soil moisture sensors weather data and satellite imagery they can improve the way they manage their farms saving money by reducing wasteful practices is crucial to farmers john deere the billion maker of farm and construction machinery partners with cornell university on analytical tools for farmers the platform they developed ag analytics integrates public data sources with data from john deere equipment to give farmers insights about field conditions and more including less expensive conservation practices reduced riskdigital data managed well can also help companies reduce the risks they take every day in their business in giving credit to poor credit risks in being in compliance with regulatory authorities and much more consider hsbc the billion banking giant the bank is using ai to automate its compliance processes including anti money laundering investigations that traditionally involve thousands of employees a pilot project working with ai startup ayasdi saw the number of expensive investigations drop we reduce risks and it costs less money hsbc holdings coo andy maguire says 12progressive insurance the billion automobile insurer launched a telematics app in to collect information on customers driving over the next two years the company collected billion miles worth of driver data and analyzed it using a machine learning platform progressive was better able to distinguish between safe drivers and riskier ones and reward the safe drivers with an average discount 14intelligent systems that enable machines and people to collaborate more effectively lead to more responsive better decisions traditionally risk managers have based their analyses by examining small data sets to find exceptions to the norm such compliance checks have been routine and successfully uncover risks that need mitigation but risks can sometimes take a long time to surface in small samples today s data storage management and analysis technologies make it possible to examine much larger data sets such as all transactions a bank has processed within a period larger samples produce more reliable results and the more data ai and analytics can work with the more accurate and intelligent they become this means risks to a company s reputation finances or compliance practices can be detected more quickly and accurately the data revolutionas these examples show using digital data effectively can enable a business to make more informed and timely decisions automating analytics enables companies to create business processes that require no human intervention allowing leaders to focus on new opportunities and higher quality decision making that is the essence of business agility in the digital age once an organization acquires a comprehensive view of its data landscape and its current capabilities it can implement programs to achieve the benefits of today s new and powerful technologies this journey to more mature data handling and analytics maturity can be broken down into a series of recommended steps with a clear roadmap to data and analytics maturity that accounts for advances in data sources data management technology and analytics skills organizations can prepare to reap the value of their investment and their digital data but data by itself means little companies must make all their data meaningful that means they must master analytics techniques approaches to making sense of data not just data collection and processing alone a way around roadblocksin their efforts to reach data maturity organizations may encounter many barriers they may have difficulty realizing consistent benefits and find it hard to align data policies with evolving regulations clarity about data and analytics maturity will emerge from a frank assessment of the organization as well as what it will take to achieve its target state and realize meaningful benefits from its data in preparing a roadmap to reach the target state a company will assess its skills most importantly the business expertise it requires and identify the additional skills and talent it will need it will also identify the digital data streams and formats required for expanding the use of analytics the technologies including cloud based systems it needs to achieve company goals will become clear to ensure a company has strong capabilities in data and analytics across the enterprise and not simply in isolated pockets an organization must adopt a vision of analytics for all combining best practices and frameworks to achieve digital and analytics maturity it must not limit the use of appropriate tools to select functions or a few experts the best way to achieve enterprise wide distribution of analytic insight derived from digital data is to adopt cloud based systems these are designed expressly for universal accessibility companies need to pursue opportunities for using their digital data while anticipating regulatory changes for example the european union s general data protection regulation gdpr that went into effect in may prescribes heavy fines for violations it applies to all organizations doing business and processing personal data in the eu regardless of where they are headquartered to ensure ongoing compliance companies need to incorporate the conditions of gdpr as they build their analytics capabilities and they should continue to monitor regulatory environments in all areas of the globe in which the company conducts business joining the data first revolutionin recent years the siren call of big data launched thousands of analytics efforts across all industries and sectors digital native companies with data first mindsets emerged they took advantage of the explosion of data and the new technologies available to make it meaningful and actionable now it s time for established firms to step up they must assess how good they are at managing their digital data and with eyes wide open assess their strengths and identify areas where they need to improve companies that are superior at collecting processing analyzing and acting on data are out marketing out selling out producing out servicing and outperforming their competitors you could say without exaggeration that they are outsmarting the competition 1ifl science july accessed at 2marketwatch

56,numerous studies show that the majority of large established companies are in the midst of sizable digital initiatives to overhaul their businesses revamping key functions like marketing sales and operations introducing new digital products and services and in some cases a rethinking of the entire business model many of these incumbent industry players are in reactive mode they are trying to fend off a flood of so called born digital companies those firms launched over the last two decades as internet enabled enterprises digital business transformation is clearly an imperative it is one of the top three priorities for in out of industries according to a gartner survey of cios across countries cios from the banking and investment services telecom and government sectors indicated that digital business is their number one objective this year forty seven percent of ceos said they are being challenged by the board of directors to make progress in digital business and this enterprise wide focus on digital is also being felt by cios across industries says gartner research vp jan martin lowendahl the shift to digitally driven products and services is only intensifying according to gartner s ceo survey of ceos said that they are likely to change their business models between and ceos expect digital revenue to grow at a compound annual rate between and international data corp predicts spending on digital initiatives will grow to close to trillion in and surpass trillion by despite the prioritization of and investment in digital transformation a great many of these efforts are falling short of expectations success is the exception rather than the rule just of global companies had met or exceeded their digital goals according to a bain and company survey of more than companies less than half the success rate for conventional transformations nearly half of executives surveyed by mckinsey co in said their digital initiatives had poor results with returns of or less the reason many companies fail in their digital transformation is not complacency they clearly understand that they re operating in a disrupt or be disrupted era rather it s a failure of imagination instead of innovating many businesses are imitating digital native firms and failing in their attempts born digital companies have a number of unique advantages that existing companies can never emulate they have few existing products services or business models to slow them down and don t have to cannibalize existing and often profitable lines of business to pursue promising new opportunities they aren t burdened by legacy thinking and behaviors and instead can approach problems with fresh mindsets and approaches they don t have armies of employees who must be retrained for the digital era instead they enlist the talent they need and build entirely different cultures they aren t saddled by legacy information systems and disconnected data that can hinder connection and collaboration they can start from scratch building a brand from the ground up rather than trying to shift the market s perception of them some long standing companies however are seeing significant benefits from the digital transformation rather than mimicking digital upstarts these companies seized upon the transformational potential of technology early they saw the need to make fundamental changes in their business models operations leadership and culture long before their competition in some cases even before digital natives began to nibble away at their market share they saw the need to make fundamental changes in their business models operations leadership and culture long before their competition we call these established companies digital renovators they have been key but largely unsung heroes in the business landscape of digital transformation during the last few years they include health care giant cvs health walmart best buy ing and a number of other firms their stories have often been underplayed while the amazons ubers airbnbs and other digital natives have hogged the spotlight yet the practices of the digital renovators provide just as valuable lessons for other established companies in how to successfully transform their businesses to not only keep up with but also outpace the born digital competition in some ways their practices are more instructive for large and long established companies which can be burdened in a digital age with outdated assets cultural habits skills and other vestiges of the pre digital era reborn digitalthe biggest inhibitor to progress in digital transformation is lack of appropriate talent and capability in the workforce according to a gartner survey on digital initiatives of those companies that had launched digital initiatives said they needed significant or deep cultural change over the next three years established companies can t simply adopt the born digital playbook and expect transformation they must develop their own strategies and road maps for digital reinvention looking not at the facebooks and googles of the world but to established companies that have successfully been reborn digital these companies span industries from retail and financial services to airlines and industrial manufacturers they all had the foresight to look outside the way they had always done things to embrace the opportunities of digital technologies before they became threats they broadened their perspectives looking at the new digital ecosystems in which they could play a leadership role they recognized early the changes they had to make and realized that they often had to create new digitally enabled business models to succeed they did not wholly abandon what had made them successful in an ill guided attempt to emulate digital native companies instead they identified their most valuable assets their customer data and relationships their geographic footprint global supply chains existing information systems brand value and amplified them with new digital approaches they embraced agile ways of working to design new business systems processes and operating models they demonstrated a commitment to experimentation and continual learning and they exhibited strong change management enlisting employees in driving digital change digital renovators in actionwhile such fundamental transformation takes time the results have been far from incremental these digital renovators made big bets early on about the prospects for their organizations adapting in their quickly evolving industries and what unique role they might play in those digital futures and are already seeing returns to be sure each of these digital renovators developed their own unique digital transformation strategy we found seven elements that helped them succeed established companies that want to successfully transform the enterprise recognize that the status quo can t hold and that insular thinking and behavior will only breed complacency bringing the outside in is a great way to create the sense of urgency needed for transformation according to best selling author and leadership consultant john kotter digital renovators were not necessarily flailing when they began to look beyond themselves however they recognized that what got them to where they were would not necessarily get them where they needed to go in order to overcome legacy thinking they brought new leaders into the executive ranks often from born digital companies they tapped into the expertise of thought leaders in academia and industry to change their mindsets and get the leadership team primed to make big bets they worked with leading consultants and applied futurists cvs health more than a decade ago leaders at cvs health a u s based drugstore and retailer recognized that the company could not continue to grow as simply a traditional drugstore the specter of amazon com entering prescription pharmaceutical sales loomed large for years but the company did not wait to act nor did it attempt to simply out amazon amazon an impossible feat instead it forged its own digital plan our strategy starts with being part of the digital ecosystem says brian tilzer cvs s chief digital officer who oversees its digital innovation lab the billion company is shifting from a traditional pharmacy into a key provider of health services both in stores and within its customers homes and lives in cvs purchased a pharmacy benefits management company as well as a fast growing chain of health care clinics it could locate in its retail stores a service that a digital only drugstore could not touch by its more than minute clinics had recorded more than million patient visits in the company bought health insurance giant aetna for billion ing in european bank ing embarked on its own digital transformation with a customer centric purpose according to ceo ralph hamers it s about empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business the billion bank announced in that it would spend nearly billion on digital transformation efforts over the next five years naming its chief operating officer roel louwhoff as chief transformation officer a decade on from the financial crisis ing has the number one net promoter score for retail banking in seven countries the company believes it achieved this score by offering a differentiated customer experience in an increasingly commoditized industry one that goes beyond the borders of the banking industry it s connected to the other platforms and ecosystems where consumers spend most of their online time providing easy access to financial services where and when users need them says hamers air france klm as with other digital renovators the delivery of high quality customer experiences is driving air france klm s embrace of mobile cloud big data analytics and wearable technologies as it transforms to a digital organization the company replaced its legacy network with a superfast intelligent network across sites to power mission critical systems such as passenger check in flight operations and departure control applications a data platform to enable a degree view of its customers underpins more targeted timely and tailored customer interactions it was the first airline to use artificial intelligence to manage the increasing volume of interactions with customers over social media channels the airline also developed its own predictive analytics tool to identify potential problems and schedule repairs on aircraft and engines before they break down doing so avoids costly unplanned maintenance mitsubishi hitachi power systems power generation company mitsubishi hitachi power systems has taken advantage of internet of things iot technologies and artificial intelligence to keep the gas turbines that drive power plants up and running the company began running remote monitoring centers in to track turbine operations which have now accumulated two decades worth of historical operating data combining that with iot sensors and machine learning algorithms the company can now offer its customers predictive maintenance alerts and intelligence on how to operate their plants more effectively competitively and safely walmart walmart may be the world s biggest retailer but it must compete with digital trailblazer amazon and other online merchants in it acquired online retailer jet com for around billion and made the company s ceo marc lore the chief executive of its digital commerce business which includes overseeing a voice technology partnership with google home and a number of additional e commerce acquisitions lore also has emphasized the importance of customer centricity making the customer experience and customer care departments report directly to him for its most recent year end report walmart noted its e commerce sales grew by so what did these companies do right how did these digital renovators survive and actually thrive in an era in which many digital native companies have ripped up industries and toppled once mighty leaders from their perches from our research and client experience seven moves appeared time and again themes that differentiated the successful digital renovators from the fading stars they viewed the broader ecosystem of opportunities partners and competitors they embraced radically different business models they embraced agile methods of developing software and updating their entire business operations they pursued narrow but lucrative niches they identified key assets others viewed as legacy burdens and then built on them they conducted purposeful and powerful experimentation they mastered organizational change we now take a look at each of these moves and illustrate them with real examples tapping the greater digital ecosystem companies that succeed in their digital transformations look at the world not simply from the perspective of their own company or even their own industry they look at the larger digital ecosystem in which they operate and make investments to stake their claim within it nokia for example in its transformation from a mobile phone and network provider into a full service network infrastructure provider has taken an ecosystem approach and is now innovating in such areas as virtual reality and digital health it offers a wide range of opportunities for companies and individuals to get involved in its vision of a connected world beyond borders microsoft sees itself not just as a software player but part of a larger digital business ecosystem the once insular company bought digital business networking company linkedin tapping ceo reid hoffman for microsoft s board and recently stated that its partners would be at the center of its trillion transformation opportunity 25embracing new business models digital renovators realize that a one size fits all business model is insufficient for the digital age often establishing a portfolio of business models that expand or change over time digital technologies enable companies to reimagine every aspect of their business but only if they are capable of experimenting with them and rolling out those that have real value cvs for example has expanded beyond retail to health services we think of it as creating a new front door to health care in america cvs ceo larry merlo toldthe new york times in april cvs health announced it was working to make a new digitally enabled and monitored medical device that it hoped would increase the number of consumers who could do kidney dialysis in their homes we are basically taking health care closer and closer into the community digital is going to bring it into the home it s also putting the patient in control in a way that wasn t possible before says cvs chief digital officer tilzer said we re trying to weave digital into every aspect of our operations and business model industrial manufacturers rolls royce and michelin are deploying sensors to implement digital business models by collecting data generated by iot sensors and analyzing it using machine learning algorithms in the cloud rolls royce has gained in depth insight into the real time performance of its jet engines power generation systems and marine turbines it has built a new business of aftermarket services from showing airlines how to optimize their routes to keeping a survey ship in position in heavy seas similarly michelin has transformed its tire business into a service business using iot sensors inside vehicles to collect data like fuel consumption tire pressure temperature speed and location to be analyzed in the cloud michelin offers fleet operators recommendations and training to lower costs and improve efficiency even born digital companies continually seek out new business model opportunities amazon of course broadened its business model from online book retailer to multi category online retailer to cloud services provider aws grocer and more google evolved from an internet search engine company to online advertising provider to mobile phone provider to cloud provider and now driverless vehicle supplier going agile all over not just in software development digital renovators understand that the it organization is the engine that powers their ongoing digital transformations as a result they have been early adopters of both agile development and devops practices to accelerate the delivery of new systems and innovation in a more streamlined automated and iterative fashion air france klm cio jean christophe lalanne says that implementing agile and devops practices within the company s product teams is driving innovation as the airline experiments with such technologies as iot ai and augmented reality the aim is to develop a minimal viable product to serve a business case he says the role of it is to maximize platform sharing data sharing apis and the web services that allow consistency across different products and which are absolutely critical to the success of digital transformation digital transformation however is about more than just technology digital renovators abandon sequential siloed and bureaucratic methods in favor of agile approaches across the business to designing new business processes products services and business models ing cio ron van kemenade is a firm believer in agile methods and his devops teams are evolving toward a state of continuous delivery the goal is more than just faster software deployment or more frequent mobile app functionality releases ing is now planning to roll out the agile approach across the entire company it s about culture and behavior as well says van kemenade it s about a way of working how do you create an agile organization that is actually able to learn from customer behavior to be responsive to that to have the fail fast mentality … and if you re not successful try and improve it 31expanding into underserved yet lucrative niches a key move we have seen frequently used by successful digital renovators is shifting from offerings that address broad needs to narrow products and services catering to niche needs two companies come to mind here nikon and garmin to get there they considered the needs and problems of the end user both before and after they become customers then they create more valuable and differentiated offerings and experiences in the face of increased commoditization take camera maker nikon the market for digital single lens reflex cameras dslrs has fallen dramatically in recent years as amateur photographers opted to stick with their smartphones for photography while canon dominated this shrinking market for the last years nikon opted to focus on the higher end professional market instead understanding the needs of its advanced and professional users the billion company took the number one spot for market share and sales in the full frame digital cameras with interchangeable lenses dcil category 33or consider garmin the billion navigation system manufacturer whose operational headquarters are in the u s and parent company is in switzerland in the 1990s it was a pioneer in the market for automobile gps devices for cars which at one point accounted for nearly three quarters of the firm s revenue then along came the smartphone in which when paired with a navigation app threatened to put garmin out of business sales plummeted by nearly billion in three years and the company lost nearly of its market value but while it no longer owns the market on automobile navigation garmin has pivoted quickly since to design wearable navigation devices for distinct market sectors golfers runners bikers swimmers hikers and more the company made the shift because it saw writing on the wall that the smart phone makers would apply their embedded gps devices for mainstream uses such as driving cars and walking the niches were where garmin could thrive by tailoring its gps to the demanding needs of different outdoor customer segments by garmin s annual revenue surpassed billion returning to the level it had been in its glory days of and it s highly profitable once again with operating margins last year garmin s niche strategy and organizational model are its key competitive differentiators identifying and amplifying assets in digital transformation literature legacy is often used pejoratively much is written about the existing systems processes and business models that are said to stand in the way of moving toward a digital future digital renovators however look at their existing portfolios differently envisioning how to overcome burdensome aspects of the business and identifying key assets worth building upon with their digital plans they see legacy as an asset whether it is their global supply chain their customer data and relationships their geographic footprints their existing information systems or their brand value big box retailer best buy is another example of a successful digital shift best buy easily could have folded in the face of digital pressures particularly amazon s entry into consumer electronics instead the billion company is thriving thanks to a renewed focus on customer service and turning its brick and mortar footprint into a key aspect of its digital strategy the company turned its plus stores into mini warehouses that can get products now priced competitively quickly to customers as of september about of online orders were shipped or picked up from best buy s stores data and lots of it on customers products and services can also give digital renovators a leg up on their younger competition cvs health has an enormous amount of data on consumers health from retail transactions million customers a day prescriptions filled billion a year its pharmacy benefit management business million members its in store clinics and soon its health insurance business ing bank mines its growing troves of customer data to reshape its customer experiences its financial products and services and its future business models the digital renovators also know they must capitalize on key assets that exist outside their four walls the abundance of capital talent and capabilities investors favor companies that paint a compelling vision of the future and are run by leaders with strong character and the boldness to pursue that vision and while these companies need to employ highly skilled people they must also be proficient at tapping into the enormous pool of skills and knowledge that can be crowd sourced on the internet as well these organizations understand they must wire themselves into the capabilities of other companies the business partners that increasingly are on the periphery of their industry not inside of it looking broadly at the capabilities they need to win senior executives of these digital renovators do not regard themselves as being in a narrow industry a limiting notion that blindsides managers with tunnel vision rather they see themselves as being in a larger digital ecosystem of competitors partners and customers for example ford motor co defines its vision as making people s lives better through automotive and mobility leadership i e providing products and services that get people from one place to another whether that s through self driving vehicles renting shared vehicles on demand or some other offering that s a much bigger strategic canvas for ford than its prior one of building attractive high quality cars and trucks for people to drive promoting purposeful and powerful experimentation the best digital renovators are grounded in relentless experimentation and execution they create the kind of organizational structures that enable them to test new digital processes products and business models learning from those attempts that don t work and scaling those that do their executives and business units are open minded and curious and willing to take on both opportunities and risks even when that means overcoming the fear of cannibalization in fact rather than fear risk they embrace it because they know that a risk mitigation mindset puts a damper on innovation in the midst of what a recent wired article called the biggest strategic shift in the paper s year history the new york timesembraces what its deputy publisher described as endless waves of experimentation in recent years it became clear that digital advertising alone would not be enough to pay the bills let alone fuel growth in the future in an effort to transform thetimes digital subscriptions into the driving force of its business the company is investing heavily in its core capability the highest quality journalism while continuously expanding its new digital capabilities and services from personalized fitness advice and intelligent newsbots to virtual reality films the goal is to become so ingrained in its readers increasingly digital lives that the new york times is indispensable or look at hotels as airbnb has shaken up what was a seemingly stalwart hospitality industry with a new type of business and a new type of market segment marriott international has thrived by placing bold bets and integrating a host of digital products and services to appeal to new and growing customer segments by last may nearly a third of the company s record billion in revenue was made via digital channels according to george corbin the company s senior vice president of digital ultimately what you need to consider is the fundamental shift that is occurring in customers needs and expectations it is the job of any company ours included to ensure that we are adapting to the customer corbin says noting that marriott has grown from a brand company to a portfolio of in recent years this shift in needs and expectations means that we have to change the product change the service and continue to evolve marriott has focused significant attention on mobile testing and roll out services like mobile check in and check out mobile service requests keyless experiences and experiments in the areas of mobile food and beverage are all geared toward customers needs the bottom line is as long as you keep listening to your customers and that is something that we do religiously you will get the same cues as anybody else who is entering the industry corbin says then it comes down to can you adapt can you adjust mastering organizational change adaptability is hardly a given digital renovators must have stellar organizational change capabilities to introduce and sustain digital transformation employees at all levels must live with uncertainty and adjust to a dynamic environment the human aspect of digital change is critical and often overlooked if a company is adapting they are trying to change their operating model and that touches everything says marriott s corbin who spends of his time on change management and transformation activities a cdo has to be able to drive a change effort forward across multiple parts of the organization not just the so called digital part or the it part most of change management is much bigger than technology technology is one of the ten things that you have to get right to get transformation right he says the necessary soft skills are how do you build coalitions how do you develop talent and teams how do you communicate cdos have to be able to communicate with impact it is the seven times seven rule you have to tell people seven times in seven different ways why we are going in this new direction in addition to communication digital renovators benefit from enlisting the active participation of ecosystem partners for example as ge has progressed in its ongoing transformation from an industrial company to a digital one it has needed everyone employees partners and suppliers even customers to buy into the new vision cate gutowski vice president of ge s digital thread initiative a set of interconnected technologies that will enable the billion company to be more responsive to customers and market trends in the industrial iot ecosystem says collaboration is key ge brought people in from different levels of management functions and business units to devise and launch the program to succeed companies must make change a groundswell not a mandate gutowski says noting that an initiative simply won t work if it is only mandated and directed from the top down she adds when ideas originate from the bottom up they tend to gain more traction and get stronger buy in for a digital sales transformation for example ge crowdsourced ideas and had its sales professionals vote on them and help build the product roadmap technology teams and domain experts work together early and often to ensure high user adoption that s the only metric that matters in the digital age according to gutowski technology can t do this alone they need partners with a deep understanding of the function so we can ensure that whatever we build delivers high user adoption says gutowski companies that crack the code on enabling rapid real time collaboration will be the ones that innovate faster and win with customers overcoming the obstacles to digital transformationmuch of the attention in the digital era has been on the davids turned goliaths of digital industry who were into this era and rose to dominance or on the newer digital upstarts poised to disrupt industry incumbents it is perhaps an easier or sexier story to tell after all fundamentally changing people process and technology in a decades old company takes significant time effort and resources the odds are seemingly stacked against transforming existing entities they re built for stability not innovation they re slow and inflexible their legacy systems people and processes can hold them back yet it is possible there are instances of successful digital transformation within traditional companies in nearly every industry today and their narratives of digital renovation and how to achieve it have more value to the vast majority of enterprises than those of the digital natives they offer a digital transformation playbook for the rest of us others can follow their lead by taking actions that increase the likelihood of a successful and sustained digital transformation including lead with transformation digital disruption should not be left to the digital natives companies that want to remain competitive in the years ahead will have leaders who embrace digital opportunity or bring in new executives that do they will harness data and intelligence to get better views about operations to make them more efficient to understand customers better to increase employee engagement and to recognize both opportunities and threats on the horizon expand the playing field digital renovators reimagine business strategy within the bounds of broader ecosystems they explore new ways to work with existing ecosystems or create their own identifying and adopting the emerging and enabling technologies required to do so take a portfolio view of business models it s become clear in recent years that no business model is safe from disruption digital leaders recognize this and are willing and able to expand and shift business models in a dynamic marketplace product companies expand into services industrial manufacturers become technology providers turn liabilities into assets digital renovators seek out the value in their existing businesses brand value popular products and services underappreciated customers or business units corporate culture legacy systems teeming with valuable data brick and mortar operations and incorporate them into their digital strategies embrace agile approaches it organizations are increasingly adopting new approaches to technology innovation development and implementation digital leaders take an agile approach across the enterprise when designing new business systems processes and operating models establish a culture of experimentation some companies particularly young startups can adapt quickly and experiment with new approaches within established companies the primary focus is on existing products services and customers digital renovators must make a deliberate effort to test new ideas often creating new processes for doing so to ensure they are pushing their boundaries put people first technology itself is only a small part of digital renovation those companies dedicated to long term transformation invest in change management enlisting employees in visualizing and driving the change don t wait it s always more beneficial in the long run to disrupt yourself before you are disrupted a successful digital transformation requires the courage to take calculated risks before things get bad successful digital renovators made fundamental changes in their business models operations leadership and culture before they had to and those seeking similar results will do the same 1gartner smarter with gartner is digital a priority for your industry

57,business guru peter drucker famously said the purpose of a business is to create a customer six decades after he penned that sentence a number of enormously successful ceos have taken drucker s credo to the max among them jeff bezos of amazon who has driven his firm to focus on customer obsession vs competitor obsession and richard branson whose many virgin companies have ascended in industries known for poor service3 those and other ceos believe that creating customers and keeping them happy is at the center of their success unfortunately digital transformation efforts at companies across the globe often aren t putting customers at the center of their endeavors instead new technologies are being used to create operational efficiencies to reduce costs while that s important too often the price companies pay for this narrow focus is exasperated customers struggling with poorly designed experiences and inconsistent and inauthentic touch points with the brand yet a number of other businesses both b2b and b2c are starting to realize that digital transformation strategies must begin with the customer experience cx they understand that creating a differentiated and competitive experience attracts new customers and keeps them coming back a major driver of profit and recurring revenue they have found that superlative consistent and authentic experiences have better roi than advertising enterprises across the globe are making significant investments in digital transformation efforts technology researcher international data corp forecasts that these expenditures will climb by in to nearly trillion by they will have jumped to more than trillion this rapid proliferation of smart technologies combined with the declining cost of computing and storage power has put most technologies especially analytics and advanced machine learning in the hands of practically every business no matter its size thus just having the latest technology won t provide a competitive advantage customers are demanding better experiences from the organizations they do business with and companies must meet or exceed those demands to be successful customers expect performance responsiveness authenticity and consistency in messaging and tone the winners will be those companies that create customer experiences that are better than their competitors and more in tune with how customers want to do business with them comcast the billion u s based media entertainment and communications company is a case in point the company had created several new product innovations including voice activated controls and a cloud based video platform for viewing tv programs and movies on multiple devices but the customer satisfaction needle didn t move as expected comcast s leaders realized that its customer experience needed to be as novel and useful as its product innovations so comcast embarked on a major reorganization putting product innovation and customer experience under the same roof the result a highly personalized experience that uses machine learning to recommend content customers love need and want to experience but equally important comcast didn t just focus on the front end of the experience it tracked the impact of its offerings through it investments accounting and customer care and used technology to ensure that the end to end customer experience it delivered was both smooth and cost efficient the big lesson when looking at technologies for back office applications comcast thought beyond efficiencies it made sure that customers would have a far better experience in using its product innovations one that would become a competitive advantage to comcast focusing digital transformations on the customer experience forces companies to address empathize and understand all the touchpoints in which they interact with customers every day the marketing campaigns they view the sales people and processes with which they engage whether via humans or digital assistants such as chatbots and where they first encounter a company s products and services online or offline data points the way to where to make improvements companies must focus their transformations using enterprise and ecosystem data to discover customer preferences and patterns they then need to model a competitive holistic experience customer data and the insights derived from it is the key to understanding where to invest and which investments will yield significant roi why is keeping the customer in mind so hard it s easy to take one s eye off the customer when tackling digital transformation a common challenge is a relative dearth of accurate customer insight customer data is often trapped within the organizational silos of the sales customer service marketing and finance departments and can t be linked to create a holistic view of the customer a lack of usable harmonized data inevitably leads to endless debate about what the customer experience should be why and where as a result transformation initiatives lose steam and unsubstantiated assumptions can lead to futile outcomes moreover businesses sometimes see cx solely either in terms of customer acquisition or customer service thus they don t think broadly about customer preferences and how to design an experience that caters to continuous engagement starbucks in contrast thinks about far more than the efficiencies of serving a cup of coffee it is focused on delivering a superior in store experience going to great lengths to provide warm comfortable and useful environments providing wi fi for example where people can socialize or work just as important the company also has an easy to understand loyalty program a poorly designed cx transformation can actually worsen the overall experience a company provides customers individual functions chase digital ideas in a strategic vacuum that may create efficiencies and productivity gains for themselves but for no other part of the organization and they also miss most if not all opportunities to use digital technology to improve brand awareness customer acquisition and customer retention indeed not putting the customer experience first risks sending them running to competitors if the user experience ux is confusing or clumsy customers will run to competitors and if the cx and ux are not consistent across channels and customers can t do what they need to do when and how they want they are likely to look elsewhere for a better experience blockbuster learned a hard lesson about slighting the customer experience the once famous u s video retailer was not avoiding technology it had invested in analytics to improve the profitability of its in store video mix as the volume of available content rose its rival netflix however began with the customer experience deploying an online recommendation engine that helped consumers find programming in the content cornucopia that best suited their interests and tastes netflix also helped customers avoid having to go to video rental stores and find the videos they wanted were out of stock at the same time blockbuster tried to guard its bottom line by maintaining its customer hostile late fees which customers detested netflix touted the fact that it had no such fees netflix thrived blockbuster failed filing for bankruptcy in the lesson is that digital transformation efforts that don t put the cx first can waste both money and effort or as blockbuster discovered it can end the game for good revamping the customer experiencecompanies can begin their digital transformation by following a two step process to transform the experience they offer their customers the starting point is to be informed by data driven by empathy and focused on real change once an organization has a firm view of customer patterns and preferences and the current state of its cx it can turn to techniques such as design thinking and enablers such as artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning to develop new methods of delivering a cx that offers significant roi valuable tools include mapping the customer experience and journey service blueprinting and using collaborative and iterative design processes such as agile to develop innovative and differentiating cx and ux in smaller and faster increments data informed insightsbusinesses should generate insights about the customer experience across the entire customer lifecycle from brand awareness to triggers that launch a buying process to the decision to make another purchase organizations should identify both their current strengths and the pain points that might drive a customer to a competitor businesses need to understand where customers want to engage with them what needs customers want fulfilled and how they want to engage with the brand for example by using data to understand what people do in their cars automakers are extending their relationship with customers beyond the point of purchase by leveraging the internet of things iot artificial intelligence ai and analytics automakers are rapidly becoming information companies automaker bmw for example thinks of its i3 electric cars as much more than vehicles the company is testing services such as drivenow a car sharing app for bmw i3 and i8 cars and parknow which identifies garages with available parking and allows users to reserve spaces in advance thereby providing experiences that becomes essential and drives loyalty data informed insights also help automakers provide maintenance services with in vehicle sensors that can tell them when a customer needs an oil change on board gps can steer them to a nearby partner or dealer this provides automakers with incentives to use their partners and create incremental revenue while providing a valuable compelling cx that tells the customer the company knows who they are and what they want and need thinking by designdesign thinking puts the end user first and addresses their environment and what they need and want from a product or service for example when lincoln redesigned its town car for the brazilian and indian markets it looked at the needs of luxury car users in a larger context both brazil and india suffer from heavy traffic and air pollution so lincoln made the car airtight because of endemic traffic delays business meetings are often held in cars so lincoln equipped them with tray tables and other conveniences design thinking must be informed by rich data sets about customers and their environments these insights lead to ideas that can be tested rapidly through prototypes the foundation of agile development the product concept can then be refined based on those tests plus customer feedback and only then brought to market this type of thinking has helped massmutual a major u s insurer with billion in annual revenue by collecting and analyzing customer data the company realized that any new life insurance product it created was unlikely to appeal to the under demographic these consumers needed to be educated about such a policy s value to them so in massmutual developed an education focused buying experience based on what it called a master s program for adulthood instead of providing just an online learning program massmutual created a multi channel experience including state of the art budgeting and financial tools and a curriculum ranging from investing in a k retirement account to buying good value wine the service also offered offices with classrooms and libraries that customers could use because the program was so different from what massmutual typically offered the entire organization had to be redesigned to support it a hallmark of a successful digital transformation driven by the customer experience the tech under the hooddeveloping compelling and competitive customer experiences is a team sport organizations need to bring together a diverse range of people and disciplines to fertilize thinking and develop the best ideas based on data design thinking and a strong business case all of which feed off one another data and analytics inform the design process analytics can then establish which design choices are the best investments finally design processes yield prototypes to test which provides the greatest roi companies should use both internal and external data depending on the product and predictors of success for example insurance and financial products rely heavily on external data such as life events e g buying a house or having a baby food products on the other hand often correlate with attitudinal characteristics associated with lifestyle both use internal data such as responses to offers to understand what strikes the strongest nerve in the market sensor data from the iot can amplify analytics efforts by collecting data on products and services as they are used in the field companies can greatly expand their offerings and improve the cx automakers for example could find out what restaurant their drivers typically eat at and then partner with those restaurants to offer incentives to stop there it s important to note that the new revenue is derived from the data and insights into behaviors not from the car itself the same applies to other partners that provide service such as parts and body work social media rounds out the picture by assessing the sentiments customers hold about a brand or product some of the under the hood technologies and methodologies that companies can use to improve or reimagine their cx and ux include the ai advantageartificial intelligence can strengthen the value of both internal and external data through capabilities such as trend spotting and predicting changes in markets and customer behavior companies are using ai to take customer segmentation personalization and targeting to entirely new levels of competitive strength airlines for example use ai to offer dynamic pricing to individual customers as they purchase tickets online digital native uber applies the same principle one major retailer uses ai to guide customers through its stores the company installed an app on every employee s mobile device the app provides instant access to purchasing trends on specific items and in stock status in addition geo location software tells employees in which aisles customers are shopping so they can approach them to talk about the items they are looking for and what promotional offers they might take advantage of the app also shows employees which items are most profitable based on this information the retailer can segment customers based on profitability and provide them with consistent marketing messages tied to their visible preferences instead of the less accurately targeted email blasts so common among retailers the retailer s results hit both top and bottom lines an increase in revenue with a decline in marketing expenditures but the value of ai in retailing and other industries goes far beyond personalized marketing messages and helping employees lavish attention on the most profitable products and customers those ai applications are largely based on structured digital data the kind that has populated databases for decades e g customers past purchases product specifications including pricing and the like one of the great but largely untapped sources of ai technologies is in making sense of unstructured data digital copies of handwritten documents images of customers and products and other information that requires advanced computer vision technology to digitize it as well as enormous amounts of computing power to process it rapidly that computing power is increasingly the preserve of public cloud vendors such as aws google and microsoft that have spent billions of dollars on advanced data centers this kind of artificial intelligence which can capture and make sense of spreadsheets as well as static and moving images of people and products will enable companies to offer customer experiences that many can t even imagine today like what you might be asking one is shopping in a store without a checkout stand or checkout clerks the technology exists today to allow a store s customers to pull products off its shelves put those items into a bag and then walk out and pay automatically without having to swipe a credit card or pull a smartphone out of their pocket think that s science fiction no longer in fact it s happening at companies like not surprisingly amazon this january it opened a grocery store called amazon go in its home city of seattle the store has digital cameras in the ceiling and the company s ai technology at hand to make sense of all the action in the aisles by carrying a smartphone customers enter the store and scan a qr code on their amazon go app then they travel down the aisles and grab products off the shelves the cameras the ai software that s working behind the scenes and a digital connection to the customer s credit card account enable the store to recognize what products the customer left with and then charge them to their account 9no checkout lines no checkout stands no checkout clerks and yet no shoplifting customers get through a grocery store faster which benefits customers of course and amazon gets more customers in and out of the store which means it can handle more customers that s the power of the next wave of ai technology that can recognize images and video not just numbers design thinkingdesign thinking has emerged as one of the most powerful ways to encourage out of the box ideation design teams shouldn t be relegated to designers they should include strategic thinkers operations managers front line customer service managers designers technology experts and others who have keen perceptions about the world outside the company s four walls a vibrant combination of skills and perspectives on customer needs is critical to figuring out how to use technology to get the greatest value for customers data about customer preferences and existing trends are where design thinking begins for example realizing that consumers were becoming accustomed to making purchases streaming music buying movie tickets and renting cars by pushing a few buttons on their smart phone disney invested approximately billion into the disney experience for its disney world theme park in orlando florida visitors receive a wrist band that allows them to open room doors make reservations for attractions and pay for food and other items with a swipe of their hand launched in disney estimates that of its patrons use the device attesting to its popularity as part of the disney experience u s retailer target acted to improve its customer experience when it added an indoor mapping section to its smartphone app the company refers to it as a gps for the customer s shopping cart all a customer has to do is clock on an item on the shopping list they have created in the app and the map shows them where it is it also displays promotions and where the relevant items are located the app uses bluetooth beacons built into new led lighting to enable the service agile developmentagile development is a cornerstone of design thinking and effective product and experience design the method relies on frequent tests and iterations so that a final product or service can be developed quickly and be pressure tested before a company makes a major investment agile product development starts with a minimum viable product that includes only the essentials that need to be validated the process then refines the idea via iteration and market input companies can then test and refine other features in rapid succession to determine the scope of the final product or service this process significantly reduces the chances of falling flat in the market complex products often need a robust technology platform for prototype testing cloud based system providers can meet the needs of global firms using algorithms to analyze complex usage patterns and can also test in multiple languages insurance provider usaa recently opened its own design studio in austin texas staffed with professionals from different fields and disciplines the goal was to look beyond solutions typically offered by insurers to create game changing improvements in usaa s cx usaa members don t compare us to other insurers says meriah garrett usaa chief design officer they compare us to every other digital interaction they have with facebook google amazon and venmo venmo provides digital payment services to offer a digitally competitive cx usaa focused on self service offerings such as on demand updates on customer policies payments accounts balances and so on delivered through a mobile app the company also plans to leverage machine learning and ai to gain deeper insights into what more it can offer 12the best customer experiences are interactive and delivered through a mobile device but the mobile experience must be consistent with the experience at other customer touchpoints this can be a significant challenge especially for financial services institutions according to forrester research banks are losing sales because they don t help customers research or apply for financial products on their phone making matters worse according to forrester is the high level of usability flaws in many banking mobile apps that make them very hard to use on the other hand usaa received forrester s highest ranking for mobile usability as did the global spanish banking group bbva and ally bank in the u s cx harmonizationgiven the proliferation of channels available to consumers seeking information goods or services a company s cx and ux need to be consistent across all of them a seamless multi channel experience is no longer a nice to have it is a must have voice activated devices such as amazon echo and google home now seamlessly integrate with websites social media online search and recommendations and that s what consumers want and increasingly demand providing that harmonized and personalized cx and ux depends upon having a single view of the customer that combines data from all interaction points a consistent customer view and experience is essential for both b2b and b2c companies businesses such as nationwide vanguard and usaa have achieved this consistency for example customers can interact with nationwide via mobile apps email or amazon s digital assistant alexa in any case the message and experience are always the same customers can ask alexa anything from when their next insurance premium is due to when their claim is scheduled to be reviewed if alexa can t answer the customer s question she connects him or her with customer service if she can t understand what the customer is saying she alerts nationwide s system which automatically calls the customer back and the call will be consistent with the phrasing and tone the company uses across all channels 16mutual fund advisor vanguard also has created a consistent and compelling omnichannel cx a challenge for many retail financial companies is understanding which investments make the most sense for specific customers vanguard created its virtual personal advisor to do just that the advisor is personalized easy to use and when appropriate connects the customer to human financial advisors thereby reinforcing the firm s commitment to providing low cost guidance for financial planning to develop these experiences vanguard used its own business design methodology as john mercante vanguard s cio says the process allows vanguard to take an iterative approach and leverage an experimentation based design process the iterative development allowed vanguard to test individual components of the service with small groups of early adopters to improve it before it was launched and the company s it architecture was configured to help the design team test iterate and reuse components of the service in other offerings before it developed its app usaa s offerings looked the same to all customers now personalized landing pages show those tasks and activities the individual customer most frequently conducts to make the cx seamless usaa has created a contact handoff system through the mobile app that connects users to a service representative the representative can see relevant data about the customer before he or she is connected so the agent can prepare for the conversation sharing context and customer data across all touchpoints saves customers time and allows them to define the experience they need and want a to do list for executives to create a superior customer experience companies should begin by benchmarking customer behaviors in each channel they occupy then they need to answer these critical questions does the organization have channel transition plans for its various it systems so they all can connect is the organization measuring customer satisfaction with the cx for example are voice and text analytics being used to assess levels of frustration or satisfaction once these questions are addressed the business needs to turn to the talent part of the cx equation creating compelling customer and user experiences requires the services of a dialogue editor who can write scripts across all channels and work with creative teams to make sure the messages are in synch with each target audience communications must also match the customer s vernacular not the company s internal jargon if businesses don t they risk frustrating customers and finding themselves the target of negative social media sentiments to make the most of design thinking businesses should use it to personalize the customer experience as much as possible for instance a credit card company can know where a card holder is via their smartphone by knowing that and seeing where purchases are being made the company can detect fraudulent activity and notify the customer this capability builds the trust and confidence that drives loyalty equally important it gives the customer the sense that the company knows him or her and that is the cx that wins the same capability and analysis can help the credit card company create affiliate marketing programs that offer coupons for restaurant chains that customers can use at their discretion the card issuer can analyze the roi of this value added service and revise as needed in a continuous re evalution of its offerings this re evalution is critical as customer experiences are highly competitive today s great idea quickly becomes tomorrow s table stakes to keep their customer experiences fresh and competitive companies should constantly strive to reduce the number of steps a customer must follow to conclude a transaction using automation enabled through ai is becoming the norm for providing experiences at the speed customers want equally important the ux should be as simple and as intuitive as possible amazon is the classic example once a customer puts something in the virtual shopping cart it only takes one click to make the purchase follow the roicreating and upgrading customer experiences takes a substantial investment in time money talent and other organizational resources consequently many companies struggle to build their cx business cases leaving them inadequately funded or on the budget s cutting room floor again finding the roi begins with data by sharing customer data across business units and functions from sales to service to marketing organizations can see the value of cx investment whether it s attracting new customers increasing customer retention times or increasing sales for innovative products or services developed to meet new data derived needs for instance opportunities for cross selling proliferate when customers are shown products synergistic to ones they ve just purchased of course that sales data must be visible to r d and marketing once the company has established the cx roi it needs to bake it into the design process for example an iot coffee maker designed to track customers coffee consumption and let them know when they need to reorder coffee pods must calibrate the potential extra pods sold against the cost of adding iot technology to the coffee maker that calculation could lead to more optimal replenishment options such as working with a third party provider your customers aren t waiting for youcustomers are picking up their mobile phones to find and purchase goods and services they re talking to alexa customer behaviors are changing and in some sectors they re changing very quickly all that businesses can be sure of is that their customers preferences will change successful companies are moving aggressively to digitize their business processes and operations to change along with their customers rapidly the most successful organizations begin by focusing on where their customers are moving what they want and how they want it they begin their digital transformations with the customer experience they use customer data to inform decisions and commit to a design thinking approach to create new experiences built on flexible modern platforms they use evidence based business cases to justify investment and they test new ideas through rapid iteration to make alterations and validate assumptions this is a never ending process leading companies understand this customers never stay still and neither should the experiences that companies provide them

59,many companies believe they can compete in the business 0tm world merely by digitizing their existing products and services and the key business processes that create demand and supply for them that would be a mistake instead leaders should take a step back and consider how they can reshape their entire business around digital technology thus reinventing their business using what we refer to as a machine first approach to digital transformation by machine first we do not mean replacing every possible human worker with artificial intelligence and other technologies that automate labor instead the machine first approach asks leaders to determine how to use three key digital technologies cloud computing artificial intelligence and analytics in every aspect of their business in the products and services they offer how they develop their offerings how they create supply and demand how they support their customers and more by combining an agile approach to developing and continually improving these products and processes companies can become digital powerhouses with new data fueled business offerings that delight customers it is how a growing number of companies have become leaders in their sectors digital natives such as amazon in ecommerce and cloud services netflix in streaming movies uber in taxi service and peloton in fitness equipment but it s also the way that companies founded before the rise of the web are now overtaking competitors cvs in pharmacies and health clinics abn amro in european financial services cummins in the truck engine market and many others in industries that have rapidly been digitizing to take a machine first approach to revamping their business executives must look for ways to eliminate unnecessary manual work of both the production and knowledge types but leaders also must then free up employees to take on new roles and learn new skills at the same time they must reimagine and reposition their it function making its focusbusiness first and its core capabilities ones we describe as ubiquitous polymorphic and secure in this article we explain in more detail why companies should take a machine first approach to digital transformation how to do it and the capabilities they will need especially their it function to make it real reshaping the businessin the business world many products and services are becoming a purely digital phenomena accessed through a digital device think streaming movies to your smartphone or laptop computer or finding homes to buy and obtaining a mortgage through your tablet computer or making a stock trade or purchasing a ticket to a play or concert they re increasingly becoming digital offerings secured through digital means in this transformation technologies such as automation cloud computing and the internet of things iot devices enable companies to make unprecedented and swift changes to their business models they also allow companies to make major improvements in key business processes marketing and selling product development production and distribution order fulfillment talent management and more as companies increasingly compete in a business world they need to take a machine first approach to rethinking and redefining every aspect of their organization this would include reexamining the following business models what they sell to whom they sell it and how they generate revenue from the transaction for example billion engine manufacturer cummins found a new revenue stream by digitally tracking the post sale performance of its engines and providing remote monitoring that alerts trucking customers when their vehicles need preventative maintenance launched in as connected diagnostics the service tracks more than cummins engines today in north america more than times the number just three years ago core products and services these increasingly will shift from analog alone to digital or a combination of the two for example privately held stationary bike manufacturer peloton has reached million in annual revenue and a billion valuation not only by selling its bikes for home use but also by offering a subscription for a month to live streamed exercise classes these subscriptions have played a part in helping peloton achieve more than annual revenue growth since its launch in for this stationary bike manufacturer the product is no longer just the bike but also the fitness exercises that come with it marketing and sales advances in analytics enable companies to mine big data and unearth insights about the products and services that customers need and want and how they use and react to them companies can use these findings to develop tailored promotions that are more likely to achieve sales goals one major telecom company was able to reduce customer churn significantly by tracking customer account data and creating customized offerings to retain their most at risk customers production and distribution processes multiple business technologies are converging to improve and reshape the supply chain improvements in analytics make it easier than ever to track every item at every link in the chain helping to spot fakes and prevent theft 3d printing enables companies to move production all the way downstream even to a customer s home or business synchronization among manufacturing distribution and order fulfillment makes it feasible for companies to produce customized products for individual consumers in pharmaceuticals for example advances in genomics and precision medicine increasingly enable the development of medicines tailored to an individual s specific genotype which have huge potential to be more therapeutically effective with fewer undesirable side effects customer service ai technologies are helping contact center reps and field service technicians deliver higher quality service however at the same time smart self correcting connected iot products may reduce the need for human interventions in other words products ranging from cars to barbecue grills will increasingly fix themselves sophisticated data driven chatbots are handling many routine customer inquiries thus helping companies reduce the costs of call centers by obviating the need for human customer support where human customer service reps are needed to deal with more complex situations they can process calls better and faster when working hand in hand with virtual agents that have already captured all the critical information on the customer s issues r d data analytics can guide product development teams by showing them which innovations are likely to make the biggest splash in the marketplace remote analysis of real world product performance can give marketing managers valuable insights on ways to improve quality and customer satisfaction sales force teams can use analytics to get location specific visibility into how well supply and demand are matching up in their territory talent management ai also can assist with everything from hiring and development to engagement monitoring to find motivate and retain the best employees ai will increasingly be used to determine which roles in a company are far more important than other roles and the effectiveness with which people in those roles operate finance and accounting analytics can help companies accelerate cash flow by automating accounts receivable and accounts payable while analyzing expenses to find ways to reduce costs many companies will be tempted to use technology to make incremental improvements to their existing business processes but a machine first delivery model calls on companies to rethink each element of their business using the powerful ai automation cloud analytics and iot tools at their disposal companies have a golden opportunity to rethink their business model which customers they should target what products and services they should develop for those customers as well as how they should create demand and manage supply many companies will be tempted to use technology to make incremental improvements to existing business processes but a machine first delivery model requires rethinking each element of their business how to implement a machine first delivery modeltmthe first step is to consider new business models that would allow the company to compete within a digital ecosystem that includes not only major players like google and facebook but also hundreds of smaller competitors and startups next companies should look into introducing new products and services in all cases the focus should be treating technology as a means to achieving desired outcomes not as an end itself for example the retail industry is ultimately about delivering goods to customers in their homes among other benefits such as promoting its prime service amazon saw an opportunity to use its whole foods acquisition to enhance the value of its alexa virtual assistant by allowing users to order groceries via alexa while establishing distribution centers for the groceries that those users order in the automotive industry manufacturers such as ford bmw and toyota are responding to the growth of the sharing economy and companies such as uber and lyft they are looking for ways to expand beyond manufacturing and supplying cars toward reinventing themselves as mobility companies that get people from a to b by using iot systems to monitor automobiles and make software fixes downloads automatically as tesla among others have begun doing and to keep customers happy automakers have started dispatching technicians to repair cars at customers homes and offices rather than making customers disrupt their day by driving to a service center and leaving their car for repairs this essentially amounts to a digital redefinition of an industry it will have huge implications for companies whose products can be digitized think media entertainment and financial services in the real estate sector mobile app provider zillow has moved from providing home price estimates to generating leads for real estate agents that s easy for zillow to do given that its site has million visitors every month more recently the billion revenue company has been partnering with banks to provide mortgages to its users and in august it entered the mortgage origination business itself through an acquisition 5it s useful to think about zillow s digital journey from data provider to mortgage underwriter it entered the digital marketplace in as an online database of homes in the u s it produced a highly popular mobile app that let home buyers to preview homes for sale as they walk or drive about street by street now with more than million app users it is providing more value to its home buying shoppers helping them get through the onerous mortgage loan process that is a huge opportunity for zillow especially given that the share of u s home mortgage money loaned by the three biggest u s banks fell from of all new mortgage lending in to by september the biggest mortgage lenders by volume are now non banks e g quicken loans only two were in the top in 7financial services firms around the world are encountering uncommon and often digitally unfettered competitors and many established banks are fighting back successfully after determining a new business model as zillow did for its business the next step is to design and build the business processes necessary to support those new products and services here the focus always should be on delivering a superior customer experience for example through ai enabled and digitally sophisticated chatbots that can handle issues by knowing customer histories and respond accordingly in a human manner of course it s important to put security at the heart of any new digital offerings or business process the machine first delivery model relies on collecting and analyzing massive amounts of customer data that data needs to be protected and it s much better to integrate security into system architecture from the start rather than trying to bolt it on after the fact one benefit of cloud computing is that patch management and security updates can be delivered remotely and automatically to distributed systems this can help companies maintain regulatory compliance while protecting both software and hardware from bad actors as companies develop these new systems models products services and processes they will need to adopt agile automated systems to minimize disruptions to existing core businesses but the next step will be to empower and reskill the it function that will enable it professionals to play an even bigger role in the transformation of their company we ll explore that in more detail next where we tested the machine first approach first on ourselvesfor years tcs leaders have believed there is no better way to test a new consulting approach than to test it on ourselves toward that end we launched several initiatives in the last two years to refine and improve our machine first delivery approach to digital transformation those initiatives have already had significant impacts in two areas talent development and energy usage let s look at talent development since we are in the business of helping large global companies transform themselves with digital and other technologies it would be very easy for our employees skillsets to become outdated since a number of technologies have been turning out to be crucial to many companies big data and analytics tools digital sensors and other internet of things technologies cloud computing and artificial intelligence among them and yet the supply of highly skilled people in those arenas remains relatively small as it does for any new or fast evolving technology in addition to finding that talent tcs management also believes highly in retraining current employees it s a philosophy that has helped us more than double our revenue since to billion and double our headcount to nearly today we have trained of those employees to improve their skills in these emerging digital areas through digital learning we took a machine first approach beginning in to internal training and development prior to that internal training was largely through traditional classroom lectures at our facilities worldwide we realized that this would be the slow highly expensive and often not highly effective approach to learning new consulting and technology skills as a result we have redesigned our training and development processes from scratch we took our classroom training content and converted it into online modules we now have an immense digital learning platform with more than online courses and guided tutorial sessions from that platform we issue certifications to our people over the last nine months alone some associates in countries have developed new competencies in key digital areas such as analytics internet of things cloud agile and machine learning online training delivered just when an employee needs it and not when a classroom session is offered and at a convenient place wherever they are sitting has proven to be hugely successful to tcs and its employees the second place in which we have applied a machine first design approach is energy management our company has a huge electricity bill in the millions of dollars we have large buildings across india from which we deliver many of our services in all we have operations in countries and nearly delivery centers our indian facilities collectively house about tcs people about of the population of chicago and they work in aggregate space that is five times the capacity of the world s tallest building the story burj khalifa in dubai in total tcs more than facilities in india were consuming mwh units of electricity annually by using machine first principles and technologies such as iot cloud and analytics we instituted energy saving practices such as automatic shutdowns of light and heat in unoccupied spaces this year s total electricity bill will remain the same as last year s even though we have increased our floor space we have many other machine first initiatives at tcs including in human resources especially in using social media to recruit new employees across the world finance and our internal it function we have data centers across india we expect the returns on them to be just as substantial and in some cases even more the machine first delivery model four keys for it managementone of the biggest transitions for a company to make in a machine first digital transformation will be in the it function specifically the it group will need to make four fundamental changes in the way it operates if it hasn t already done so making data ubiquitous the first aspect of making data ubiquitous in a company is identifying all the data it needs to run a superior business much of this data is in the hands of other parties in its ecosystem suppliers partners customers and other external parties walmart s ecosystem includes suppliers e g procter gamble and distribution partners that are key elements in making products available in the right quantities and at the right times in walmart stores once they seamlessly combine such ecosystem data with internal data companies that design their business with a machine first approach do not hoard or isolate that data instead they give real time data to employees at all levels when and where they need it as one cio of a large pharmaceutical company has said the way to avoid the finger pointing between business and it on data is by making data available to everyone but data alone is not sufficient the it function needs to provide analytics tools as well as the insights about the company and customers suppliers etc that those tools generate throughout the company for example having deep insights about exactly why customers buy from a company is crucial to that company s marketers sales force customer service agents r d and finance if the pricing group sits there among others embracing polymorphic analytics and other uses of digital data following the greek meaning of the term having multiple forms polymorphic in this context is about tailoring analytics applications to the needs of managers and other workers function by function each c suite executive in a company has his or her own key metrics the it function must tailor data analytics tools to each of their needs for example analytic tools for cfos should bring unprecedented insights on cash flow margins and risks a chief operating officer would need analytics tools tuned to such metrics as the customer experience customer satisfaction and on time delivery of orders then those executives must be trained on how to use the tools if they aren t the insights are likely to go untapped here s an example at the mall of america in minnesota mapping wi fi data allows mall retailers to identify customer movement through the facility and optimize their offerings to attract them as well as use weather data to predict mall traffic but such data is only valuable if the mall s business users including store managers become power users as the mall s it director says 9maintaining a focus on customer needs as machine first companies embrace advanced technologies they must guard against getting so wrapped up in the wizardry of technology that they lose track of their core mission to satisfy internal and external customer needs and exceed their expectations in all cases a machine first delivery model should also be business first technology should be deployed first in the service of the business not to make things easier for the it function although a lot of simplification needs to be done there too embedding security in every system because the machine first delivery model is based on the proper use of data companies that adopt the approach must take extra care to make sure their data is protected from both external and internal threats as machine first companies embrace advanced technologies they must guard against getting so wrapped up in the wizardry of technology that they lose track of their core mission to satisfy customers machine first won t mean machine onlyemployees have understandable concerns that ai machine learning robotics and other technologies that enable automation will eliminate their jobs however history suggests that new technologies create more jobs than they destroy in the 1800s agriculture accounted for almost of jobs in america the mechanization of farming associated with the industrial revolution did cause a decline in farm related jobs by but it did not lead to widespread unemployment because new jobs opened up in other fields including jobs associated with the design manufacturing sales and repair of industrial farm equipment by for example mckinsey global institute predicts that automation could displace some million workers worldwide but that other catalysts including rising demand for health care from aging populations and new investments in infrastructure and energy should still generate demand for up to million new full time equivalent positions 10it is true that some companies generate more revenue today than they did decades ago despite employing many fewer workers at the same time even leading digital first companies like amazon are investing heavily in retaining and adding employees in the first quarter of amazon employed more than half a million people up more than from the first quarter of 12the machine first approach is based on using automation ai and other advanced technologies to enhance the work of people not to displace them indeed much work based on manual labor will be automated but that labor needs to be assigned to the new jobs and tasks of a company which we believe will be bountiful unlike in previous eras where the brute force of steam engines and gasoline motors replaced human muscle power the business era will be defined by the combination of human ingenuity with machine speed and power humans will be the guiding force helping the machines make good judgments and respond to novel situations humans and machines are already delivering impressive results in the field of robotic surgery the machine s precision reduces complications and enables faster recovery but it is human intelligence that still guides the robotic arm 13more broadly human machine collaboration allows machines to take on dangerous unpleasant or monotonous tasks while freeing humans to concentrate on the creative intellectual work that produces higher value products and services while humans performing monotonous tasks may make mistakes due to boredom and a lack of concentration regularly maintained machines can continue to perform the same functions at the same high quality day after day on an indefinite basis even the media industry has seized opportunities to leverage the power of ai the associated press news wire agency has used ai to automate the production of simple repetitive news stories on topics such as corporate earnings reports and the results of ball games freeing reporters to focus on more complex and interesting articles 14we see many opportunities for companies to improve and replace laborious and often dangerous manual work for example in manufacturing machines can take on physically difficult or dangerous tasks while humans assume monitoring and control responsibilities this division of labor can dramatically reduce health and safety risks for the human workforce while improving productivity as machines get more advanced and adaptable they can be reconfigured on the fly to produce new or redesigned products this human machine collaboration should dramatically accelerate the speed with which companies can bring products to market delivering major roi benefits to companies that can seize first mover advantages human machine collaboration should dramatically accelerate the speed with which companies bring products to market in accounts receivable machine human collaboration can help solve the problem of rampant late payments in nearly of b2b invoices in the u s mexico canada and brazil were overdue machine learning can automate what is currently a highly labor intensive process of matching invoices with purchase orders machines can learn to handle receipts and invoices according to each company s collection policies algorithms can be written that classify receivables and prioritize accounts for collection based on variables such as customer history and invoice data by extrapolating credit risk rules from large data sets machine learning can accurately spot warning signs of credit payment problems and prioritize those accounts for action in warehousing and distribution robots and other smart machines including drones can make warehouses run more efficiently and streamline delivery processes in it departments automated software distribution deployment and patch updates can liberate developers and engineers to focus on developing new products and services barriers and benefitsevery major technological change is met with resistance the machine first delivery model will be no different companies will need to invest in reskilling and retraining employees retraining efforts should focus on teaching people the skills they will need to perform their new jobs in collaboration with intelligent machines the it function must transition from a reactive to a proactive role instead of fulfilling orders and meeting demand the it function must be prepared to provide best practice advice and guidance to colleagues in each functional area at the same time companies should look for opportunities to have humans leverage their domain knowledge to help machines get better at their tasks and make automated systems more useful the machine first delivery model will be disruptive but it will not if correctly implemented disrupt the large employee base in most industries instead it will make their own work lives more human not less 1cummins press

60,to thrive in a world of customers who demand personalized customer experiences and digitally sophisticated competitors that can provide them part of the today s digital landscape that we call business 0tm companies need immense amounts of computing power to be sure they may not need this power all the time more often they require it at periods of peak demand for example when millions of customers are flocking to their website at the same time or when they must transmit massive amounts of digits to customers at the spur of the moment think streaming videos one of the biggest digital data hogs of all time for many big companies buying the computing gear necessary to process such enormous data loads has become prohibitive if the cost isn t too high finding the it people who know how to manage the data tsunamis is fortunately the remarkable decade long ascendance of cloud computing providers now makes it possible large companies everywhere are relying on suppliers of immense data processing resources on demand businesses like amazon web services google and microsoft as well as niche cloud players that are building deep competencies in different domains as a result cloud computing has become a staple of the modern it budget enterprise agility the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs 1none of this surprises us every company must now be able to deliver new digital services or tweaks to existing services in minutes or hours not days that in turn requires unprecedented amounts of computing power at the same time enterprises face constant pressure to reduce their data processing costs while complying with new data protection rules like the european union s general data protection regulation gdpr idc expects spending on cloud services worldwide to reach billion in and that within two years more than of enterprises will use multiple cloud services and platforms all in all success in a business world hinges in part on how well a company can embrace risk to shift its systems to cloud computing vendors and then manage the relationships the rewards for executives who master this will be plentiful by harnessing the immense computational power of cloud providers and the growing number of sophisticated tools such as artificial intelligence and analytics offered through the cloud these companies will able tomake better decisions more easily delight customers develop new business models faster increase revenue more rapidly as a result they have the opportunity to create exponential value for themselves and their customers in this article we explain why cloud computing represents a sea change for executives and how leaders at such companies as cargotec oy air france klm rolls royce and malaysia airlines are already embracing it we also lay out a process by which they and their it peers can determine what when and how to move their company s systems to the cloud the cloud as game changerearly implementations of cloud have already enabled companies to develop new more profitable business models cloud enabled companies can unlock new revenue channels that may not have been possible before for example rather than selling tires to commercial truck fleets michelin now also rents them on a per mile basis creating a constant revenue stream the reason michelin can do this it puts iot sensors in its tires and those tires report their usage digitally into a data center that collects the information aircraft engine manufacturer rolls royce has developed a cloud platform to house internet of things data so that it can work more closely with customers airlines and suppliers engine component manufacturers to improve engine performance and maintenance these business models are based on the continuous collection of data about how customers use a product and when those products will fail through the cloud companies can analyze this data and personalize customer offers and offerings by generating uncommon insights through cloud based analytics as a service offerings increasingly referred to as the insight economy companies can deliver timely information that customers need examples of this abound take telluslabs a satellite imagery and machine learning company that uses satellite imagery data to track the conditions of farmland in u s counties it created algorithms to predict agricultural yields crunching huge volumes of digital data daily in the company predicted the country s soybean output for september of that year within of the eventual output and made that prediction two months earlier than the u s department of agriculture s prediction 4the advantages of the cloud can be found everywhere and in every business function here are some of the biggest ones which fall into four categories superior customer experience always on everywhere rapid response and reduced costs four ways the cloud is changing the basis of competition1 enabling superior customer experiences european airline 0giant air france klm is using the cloud so that its website can handle huge volumes of customer searches for flights and fares and so it can send automated updates on customers social media accounts klm passenger count was a company record million with seat load factor also a company record making business always on everywherefinland based global cargo and load handler cargotec oyj uses the cloud to monitor conditions of key physical infrastructure and predict when equipment will need maintenance impact lower equipment downtime improved safety and higher customer satisfaction ensuring rapid responseaircraft engine manufacturer rolls royce is putting internet of things data in the cloud to work more closely with customers airlines and suppliers engine component manufacturers and improve engine performance and maintenance goal reduce plane downtime and increase safety dramatically lowering costsmalaysia airlines has moved of core applications to the cloud it expects a it cost reduction over the next five years it has also reduced the time to achieve certain financial processes from as many as hours to less than minutes superior customer experience as more and more products become commodities companies increasingly must compete on the basis of the experience they provide to customers in selecting and using their products this trend established years ago and dubbed then as the experience economy has been accelerating what s different today however is that the digital customer experience is as important as the non digital one and that they must work in tandem to delight customers but when companies talk about creating a superior digital customer experience that experience must be highly interactive with transactions clicks for information clicks to purchase and so on able to be made in no longer than a few seconds when many customers are online and trying to make those transactions concurrently that can require huge amounts of computing power it s a reason why european airline air france klm turned to cloud computing to improve its customer website klm com dealing with very high volumes of customer searches for flights and fares the airline realized it needed to put the system into a public cloud the website s performance improved dramatically and customer traffic increased exponentially in klm passenger growth reached a record million with a company record of of its seats full more than the previous year one of klm s innovations which requires enormous computing power at peak times has been automated messages to passengers who use social media such as twitter and facebook that provide status updates on flights and missing luggage the response from passengers was extremely positive and we were soon given the nickname of the social media airline says jos kerssen klm vice president of development passenger business 8always on everywherethe cloud allows companies to operate as a multi region always on enterprise customers may be located anywhere and companies need to be able to serve them even when they re far away from headquarters cargotec oyj a multibillion dollar global cargo and load handling provider based in finland uses the cloud to monitor the conditions of its key physical infrastructure sensors installed in its equipment collect data in real time and upload it to the cloud where analytics software makes predictions about when the equipment will need maintenance these insights have reduced equipment downtime and improved safety increasing customer satisfaction rapid responsecloud computing increases enterprise agility the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs when companies decide to deploy new capabilities they can get to market faster if they are doing it in the cloud accelerating the time to value cloud providers can quickly can provision the infrastructure needed to run the new systemsanother type of agility enabled by the cloud is when companies simulate new products and business processes that allows them to test them without committing huge resources to build physical representations such simulation capability is useful not only for product r d it s also applicable to asset management and optimization recruitment and workforce deployment customer experience fraud detection customer and field service and inventory management lower costscloud has enabled enterprises to reduce it spending and the cost of systems ownership instead of operating data centers they can tap the cloud for computing resources when they need them by tcs helped malaysia airlines to move of its core applications to the cloud the airline projects a it cost reduction over the next five years in addition it has reduced the time needed to run certain financial processes from as many as hours to less than minutes enterprise agility the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs five steps to a cloud powered businessbusinesses that embrace the cloud have many opportunities to transform their business models and their daily operations as with any significant initiative a successful cloud transformation requires approaching the program strategically and cautiously we advise organizations to take the following five steps to leverage the cloud step strategy information even though many companies already have some it resources and applications running in the cloud business leaders need an enterprisewide strategy to determine what kind of cloud implementation makes the most sense for the business as a whole given its specific circumstances to formulate their cloud strategies companies must factor in their digital ambitions for example whether they want to launch more digital products and services or provide digital experiences that will require enormous compute power at peak times their competition including that from digital disruptors regulatory compliance needs for example whether a country where they operate requires customer data to remain within national borders next companies should evaluate the different types of cloud implementations that are appropriate given their it resources data applications analytics platforms security services and infrastructure are all candidates for cloud transformation but they can be handled in different ways the options include using a public cloud operated by a third party a private cloud dedicated to the enterprise and managed by its it department or a technology partner or a hybrid cloud which mixes public and private cloud resources or to keep some resources on premise in their data centers with business goals defined and cloud options explored business leaders can develop a business case for cloud implementation to address the company s ambitions and the impact they will have on the company s resources such careful deliberation is critical as the wrong strategy can lead to lost opportunities as well as wasted money and time it professionals report wasting around one third of their cloud spending 12a cloud strategy will not necessarily put everything in the cloud some legacy applications may not be easily migrated in addition some applications will continue to run most efficiently on premises strategy formulation is the first step to assessing a company s cloud goals and use cases but once designed strategy is not immutable a company s subsequent technology assessment architecture design thinking migration and implementation processes may affect the strategy therefore it makes sense to maintain a team that will work on all stages of a cloud initiative to be alert to opportunities to improve the overall results more than half of large enterprises have a central cloud enabler team 13step technology assessment and architecture design once leaders define their cloud strategy they need to deeply evaluate their company s it landscape to determine how best to execute it following the assessment they should design a cloud technology architecture to understand how all the current technology and data pieces will interact whether or not they are ultimately migrated to the cloud the technology assessment should cover every it resource including applications infrastructure and connectivity data integrations within the ecosystem security if the company identifies any of the above elements as a candidate for cloud migration the next step is to determine the path forward for example some applications can be lifted to the cloud with few or no alterations many commercial off the shelf software applications such as office productivity software already are available in a software as a service saas version other applications may require small tweaks to make their capabilities cloud ready while still others will need to be re architected before they can be hosted on the cloud meanwhile as noted above some applications are not cloud ready or should remain on premises for reasons such as regulatory restrictions this will focus cloud efforts on areas that deliver the greatest benefits in the shortest possible timeframe next companies should create a migration roadmap for each it resource moving to the cloud a typical large enterprise will have hundreds of applications a big bang migration for all of them at once would be ill advised it is better to define migration phases for each resource logically grouped to be moved together a business case for the roadmap will spell out why these steps make sense in terms of strategy cost and timing determining the right order and cadence for the migration is critical to its success when the company s it resources have been evaluated it s time to design a technology architecture that defines the best cloud system for each resource and that ensures network and data security the technology architecture should include recommendations for the cloud model public private or hybrid and the provider for each resource and it should incorporate security best practices as set out by the cloud security alliance step cloud migration when the technology assessments and architecture design are completed a company can begin moving it resources to the cloud according to the migration roadmap that it finalizes in the assessment step beginning with building a solid cloud foundation architecture in the design most cloud migrations follow one of two approaches a low touch approach in migrating resources which requires no change in the resource configuration and a straight forward lift andshift model using automated tools that make the process fast and seamless about of applications are suitable for this route a high touch approach that is better for migrating applications and it resources that require some tweaking to make them cloud ready thereby and rendering them future technology proof step implementation implementation goes hand in hand with migration and proceeds in three distinct ways as determined by the technology assessment and migration roadmap as noted above certain applications and it resources will need to be modernized that is re architected or reengineered to ensure robust performance in the cloud for example a company may have to modernize its consumer facing legacy applications one way to do that is through a cloud native architecture which will ensure a superfast response to customers changing needs in addition companies will need to integrate any cloud based it systems with their remaining legacy on premises enterprise it services and processes and with each other companies also implement saas solutions such as cloud erp crm and marketing systems available from a host of providers replacing their legacy enterprise software applications step cloud managed services once a company has migrated systems or operationalized new applications in cloud it has to decide who will operate maintain and support them to ensure they perform as expected of course a company can keep that responsibility in house but this will tie up it personnel with support work and fewer people will be available to design build and test the new applications one expected outcome of a shift to the cloud is to transform the company it personnel to strategic business partners instead of only supporting the current it infrastructure that s one big advantage to letting a third party run and support a company s cloud systems and apps but there are other benefits for one managed services shift risk management to the service provider which ought to have greater expertise than the company s in house personnel if the company deems that it doesn t it is probably the wrong provider in addition cloud managed service providers may provide value added features such as metering tracking and measuring compute resource usage by individuals or groups either to better understand operational needs or reduce waste these features would be complex for a company to implement on its own in any event company leaders especially the cio must decide on a common governance structure to use with their cloud services some global companies use different cloud vendors for different lines of business or different geographic units executives who head these units should work with the group executive management and the centralized cloud enabler team to collectively set governance policies that apply to all cloud platforms deployed within the companythis will help the company run its cloud ecosystem securely and seamlessly leading the way to the cloudcloud migration is critical to digital transformation successful leadership in the digital era requires creative thinking not only about new businesses and markets a firm could enter but also how it can and should reimagine the way it runs its existing business long term success depends on a relentless focus on increasing value to customers that means feeling the pulse of the customer frequently in whatever way and through any technology that a company can use rather than imitating what competitors are doing they should concentrate on delivering unprecedented levels of value to their customers the initial shift to the cloud from on premises technology may well be costly and leaders will need to manage it carefully as part of the transformation process they must reshape the purpose and work of the it function from managing technology to strategizing how the business can use it best and then managing the cloud vendors that deliver it within it and beyond leaders will need to remain loyal to their top talent even as they automate and outsource employees current jobs finding new and better roles for high performing employees will help ensure that the company retains their talent energy and expertise for the road ahead the cloud already powers many of the most advanced and successful companies in the world it is enabling the digital transformation of large enterprises readying them to compete in a business world it s time for companies to stop thinking about the cloud and instead determine how it can dramatically improve the customer experience revenue and profits in a rapidly digitizing business landscape cloud migration

61,every large company today is swimming in a rising tide of digital data that data resides in their information systems and in the ecosystem that surrounds them the data of suppliers customers distribution channel partners and others with which they do business companies that are fastest and best at turning that data into insights and using those insights to improve their businesses will be rewarded in the marketplace they will stage more effective marketing and sales campaigns and produce more successful new products they will be faster to identify unmet customer needs and fill them they will lead in what is being referred to as the insight economy but to do this they will have to be far better at analyzing digital data the sources and types of data rising at an exponential rate some of the world s digital data today has been created in the last two years by itself the united states on average produces more than million gigabytes of internet data every minute a number that will only increase as the world of connected devices grows soon people routinely will be talking about zettabytes a trillion gigabytes of data a concept that would have been unfathomable only a few years ago in the world produced more than zettabytes zb of data a number predicted by international data corp to increase eightfold by 2that data can bring insight power and ultimately business success by the end of half of large enterprises will be selling their digital data as well as metrics insights and recommendations on what to do with it idc predicts such data provides the raw material for operating in a business world one in which a new generation of agile organizations are embracing automation robotics ai analytics and cloud computing to rearrange their marketplaces in particular artificial intelligence is poised to turbocharge analytics technologies which in turn will help managers in every industry make much clearer and faster sense of what s really happening in their businesses three quarters of executives surveyed believe ai will substantially transform their companies within three years 4at its most basic level large volumes of digital data are essential to optimizing analytics artificial intelligence ai and machine learning technologies with robotics and other intelligent systems informed by digital data companies can automate formerly manual processes in the interest of efficiency cost savings and improved customer experiences for example a manufacturer s analytics identifies a performance problem with a customer s product and provides an automatic fix through a software download automaker tesla already provides over the air digital updates and upgrades for such features as blind spot detection and performance tuning now multiple manufacturers are offering or testing field performance and diagnostics services delivered over the internet artificial intelligence is poised to turbocharge analytics technologies three quarters of executives surveyed believe ai will substantially transform their companies within three years collecting processing analyzing and acting on data has incited a revolution in management techniques in industries ranging from banking to baseball the companies that are best at analyzing digital data are leaping ahead of competitors because they generate unique insights in what to produce who to sell to and what and when to promote they are also better at understanding and managing their finances supply chains productivity challenges and human resource needs here are a few examples in electrical equipment abb the billion industrial firm that services power plants and automates industrial processes credits its abb ability platform of services with driving an increase in orders for its software

systems have never seen cloud based ai is making machine learning widely accessible and far cheaper which promises to transform a wide variety of businesses corporate boards need to take notice the extent to which an enterprise excels or fails to excel at using its data to drive growth improve profitability and manage risk will determine its future boards must understand the company s relative maturity as it relates to data analytics see sidebar what the board needs to understand about their company s analytics maturity the central role abundant data plays in today s enterprisesto compete in the fast lane companies must improve how they manage their digital data and analytics dramatically this is because we are moving from a world of incremental business process improvement to one of transformative data analytics and insights companies vary in their data and analytics maturity at one end of a spectrum there are large enterprises that have launched organization wide data management initiatives and are benefitting from them at the other end many other companies continue to manage data at the departmental level many more are somewhere in between for these companies siloed data continues to be a significant challenge and barrier for example with sales maintaining its own data on prospects and finance keeping track of who s been billed and who has paid a company only can achieve a limited analytical capability there are only a few big companies that understand all their interactions in a connected manner or possess all the information on any one customer in one place in an age where companies are leveraging data to improve every aspect of their business the traditional approach of capturing and holding data in silos will penalize those companies that still practice it we see five levels of such data maturity ranging from siloed to self optimized companies that dramatically improve their analytics capabilities gain a major competitive advantage in recent years organizations largely have focused on developing the maturity of their business processes not the data that fuels those business processes now excellence in data management is as important as process excellence there is so much data especially unstructured data that firms now need to manage and analyze this data has great potential to be tapped in novel ways by analytics but this will not be easy the world of analytics fueled insights is one of continuous disruption compared to the old world of continuous improvement analytics driven insights enable companies to make big changes fast in their people products services and the business processes that support them yet companies still are struggling to analyze their data and put them to use in a survey of organizations around the world gartner found that had not yet reached a transformational level of maturity in data and analytics despite this being the top investment priority for cios in recent years indeed rated themselves average or below average in data and analytics maturity companies that become masters at generating real time insights that can be embedded into business processes enabling them to make rapid changes based on those insights will pull ahead of their competitors think of automatic pricing updates that a retailer airline or ride sharing service provides based on dynamic changes in supply and demand or the process for a bank promoting a new service offered to consumers identified by predictive analytics as most likely to respond these examples illustrate how firms can incorporate their mature data capabilities in their every day actions companies that become masters at generating real time insights that can be embedded into business processes enabling them to make rapid changes based on those insights will pull ahead of their competitors managing analytics to become an insights driven businessevery large company today is swimming in a rising tide of digital data that data resides in their information systems and in the ecosystem that surrounds them the data of suppliers customers distribution channel partners and others with which they do business companies that are fastest and best at turning that data into insights and using those insights to improve their businesses will be rewarded in the marketplace they will stage more effective marketing and sales campaigns and produce more successful new products they will be faster to identify unmet customer needs and fill them they will lead in what is being referred to as the insight economy in the past at many organizations it was the cio s responsibility to lead the effort to drive analytics efforts now all c suite stakeholders have great opportunities before them for the ceo and heads of strategy analytics can help them craft business strategy insights will help answer the fundamental questions that every company ultimately faces e g whether the business model is about to become obsolete and how it needs to change netflix transformed the media industry by using analytics to provide a steady stream of entertainment personalized for each of its members in contrast to incumbent media companies that geared their programming toward the masses essentially appeasing everyone but rarely addressing smaller market segments the result u s consumers now watch netflix more than any other entertainment platform netflix produced content also was nominated for more emmy awards than any other network in a distinction that cable tv powerhouse hbo had held the previous years for the media industry netflix s dominance has been disruptive and has forced action from competitors as reflected in the recent costly takeover battle between comcast and disney for 21st century fox assets 18thecmo needs to prepare for the next wave of digital transformation in marketing and sales mass personalization will lead to event driven marketing edm in which companies like banks provide timely relevant offerings that helps them show they understand customers and their changing preferences and with edm a retailer no longer delivers a tailored promotion when it wants to push a product but rather when the customer has a need that requires knowing the customer s need when it arises and fulfilling it at the optimal time before he or she begins to research a solution as an example a standing desk company may deliver a special offer to professionals who search the web for information on back pain achieving edm means sharing data from sales and customer service business processes as well as incorporating external sources of data this can dramatically improve the monitoring of customer spending behavior and where they are in their customer lifecycle enabling companies to respond quickly with offers to influence their purchasing decisions similarly the chief customer officer or chief experience officer can use analytics to segment customers to determine what products and offers these smaller groups wouldrespond to now and in the future ultimately the goal is to use insights to better serve every group for instance the magicband wrist bands that visitors to walt disney world in orlando florida wear communicate with thousands of sensors throughout the park and stream realtime data to hundreds of systems disney s goal to root out all the friction within the disney world experience every disney world visitor provides the company with a series of data points that helps it continually improve the individual s experience and increase revenue when visitors are waiting in line they re not spending money at concession stands analytics can also help reduce complexity for customers for example the mortgage industry could simplify the loan origination process and personalize services by offering products such as customized loans and flexible payment options the indian government is using analytics to improve its passport services in a project that demonstrated the value of fast responses to its analysis of customer feedback data the government digitized what had been a slow process india can now issue or renew a passport within a day projects such as this highlight how effectively analytics can improve organizational agility and make continuous improvements heads ofresearch and development can use analytics to develop new products and services pharma companies are using machine learning in drug discovery to analyze how molecules interact ford is using vr to create virtual models of cars and enable designers to improve their collaboration on design changes the technology reduces the need to build physical prototypes and allows the engineers to more easily explore creative designs cosmetics companies are testing their products by creating digital twins of animal skin so they can see the reaction in a virtual environment without harming animals forsupply chain executives analytics present many opportunities to save money and increase productivity oil and gas companies have reduced maverick spending by analyzing procurement data and finding waste and fraud others use analytics to identify less costly suppliers automotive companies are using analytics to identify potential supply chain weaknesses enabling proactive countermeasures before costly problems emerge at ge a project to address redundancies in negotiated supplier contracts that were previously managed at the business unit level saved the company million in its first year 23forcfos and chief risk officers analytics technology can significantly expedite tasks such as closing the books finding bad credit risks and identifying fraud it also can be used to find accounting anomalies and comply with anti money laundering statutes currently rpa and analytics are facilitating the invoice matching process this involves automating business rules for different matching scenarios using supporting documents such as purchase orders goods receipts and contracts rpa tools can capture the details regardless of invoice format making reconciliation faster and more accurate the emerging technology of neural automation promises to do even more complex tasks such as three way invoice matching customer service organizations use analytics to get feedback on the life of products once they are in the hands of users this information is invaluable to executives in customer service manufacturing product development and service performance with sensors sending data from products in the field companies can gain unparalleled insights on what features customers are using when software needs to be updated and when products need to be repaired manufacturers of heavy equipment can use telematics to optimize equipment usage and plan for preventive maintenance forcoos advanced analytics are providing unprecedented insights into how farflung physical assets are performing they can determine which branches stores hotels resorts and other places of business are getting the most traffic which are bottlenecked and at what time and how different parts of these assets are performing this can go a long way toward improving the customer experience thereby boosting profitability legal departments are using analytics to scrutinize contracts more efficiently augmenting human efforts and reducing routine research machines can recognize parts of contracts that resemble ones that have been previously reviewed and can sift through documents far faster than humans can that saves money and increases accuracy forit departments analytics can reduce the risk of intrusion and fraud and can aid recovery after disruptive incidents analytics can sort through enormous quantities of data such as web logs alerts traffic captures and attacker artifacts to identify anomalies that might signal an intrusion then by tracing the activities of the intruder the responder can fix vulnerabilities and reduce the chances of future attacks 24as the list above demonstrates every c suite stakeholder has the opportunity to combine their contextual expertise with analytics to make their operations more efficient profitable and agile while helping them identify opportunities for savings and growth how to excel at analytics and insightsfrom our client work we have found five elements to be critical to excelling at analytics 1establishing the scope of analytics to be applied and how the analytics tie to current data conditions and the need for additional data 2determining the technologies for analyzing the data 3attracting and developing people with analytics skills 4deciding how to organize the data analysts especially to whom they should report 5understanding and monitoring security risks and privacy concerns and the ever increasing efforts to regulate these issues a discussion of each of these elements follows the scope a company s first step toward leveraging analytics is to engage key stakeholders to set the scope for the initiative the scope should be representative of the company s business goals and include the desired analytics capabilities and data required to support them the work begins by understanding the condition of the company s digital data the company needs to ascertain whether it has all the data needed to create insights and to make changes in the business based on those insights it must also determine what data is missing and where it might be collected including from external sources such as business partners for example wireless telecommunications companies struggle to retain customers in a competitive market they can use internal data to analyze network usage to predict peak volume times using high bandwidth apps and video thereby reducing customer dissatisfaction companies could also use external data such as social media streams to gauge customer sentiment and reach out to those at risk of leaving but to make these adjustments the company must have that data available and accessible external data sources represent an opportunity to augment the data companies possess to create new and deeper insights the marketplace provides all sorts of information that properly used can create tremendous value the growing data brokerage industry which collects and markets data on consumers habits is expected to reach billion in 25new partnerships are being forged to provide useful data for example the city of amsterdam uses gps data from mobile and navigation devices gathered by a private company to create models to study traffic issues in the city in india ride share and taxi services can identify the restaurants and establishments where people eat that data can be sold to other restaurants and businesses that want these people to buy their products and services the offers based on insights about customers dining histories and locations create opportunities to collaborate in an urban area digital ecosystem one that could enhance customer experiences and expand sales creating a virtuous and profitable circle new data can come from unexpected places even washing machines consider wash multifamily laundry systems a california based laundry facilities management service provider with locations in the united states and canada wash collects a vast amount of data from its extensive network of hundreds of thousands of interconnected washer dryers vending machines and payment systems working with apartmentbuilding owners wash uses this data to test manager s questions such as whether it is costeffective to switch from cash to payment cards before committing to changes 27the tools once a company has conducted a data inventory and needs assessment it can determine the analytics tools it requires to make productive use of its data to build strong data and analytics capabilities across a company and not simply in isolated pockets it must adopt a vision of analytics for all leveraging best practices to achieve digital and analytics maturity it must not limit the use of analytics tools to select functions or a small group of experts to choose which analytics technologies to use companies first must realize that the range of possibilities is vast analytic solutions vary from traditional business intelligence tools to machine learning algorithms we think of the options available as a decision fabric that includes choices relating to how systems ingest data for analysis how they store data and how they operationalize data tools to handle these tasks are evolving quickly and it important for executives to select flexible technologies that will serve their current analytics needs while remaining useful when more advanced tools that provide improved functionality become available this is important because data and analytics solutions have been broadening their scope not just in the business capabilities they provide but also in their underlying operating capability their storage and computing power are continually increasing newer mechanisms for consuming data such as immersive analytics that builds on virtual reality environments are becoming available as are expanding data sources such as data exchanges and marketplaces for business partners choosing the right tools is key to analytics success in making these decisions companies also have to consider the status of their data estates and what it will take to the modernize these assets to support analytics data estates supporting analytics can be a mix of multiple generations of data platforms including mainframes operational data stores relational data warehouses data warehousing appliances data lakes and cloudbased data platforms like the decision fabric noted above a company should consider its options for maintaining and modernizing these assets to support analytics and to continue that support as the company matures in its analytics capabilities the skills with a clear vision of its business goals and an understanding of what data and analytics technologies it needs a company then must decide what processes and skills it requires to create a successful analytics capability this entails assessing staff members competency and skills in combination with existing service delivery and governance practices executives can assemble a holistic roadmap that includes provisions for making all elements people process technology and data ready for analytics the organization in addition to recruiting analytics talent the company must decide where these analysts should sit in the organization should they be located in a centralized analytics group within a business function or in some other arrangement and who should the analytics function report to in the past analytics typically reported into finance the ceo or cio now it s clear that the function needs to have its capabilities integrated throughout the enterprise with an executive like a chief data officer or chief analytics officer leading the effort to bring analytics to every department and injecting functional knowledge about those departments into the analytics organization picture data science and other data experts working with colleagues from various business functions and product lines who can bring contextual meaning to the data this is the optimal way to structure your analytics talent the risks an analytics capability requires collaboration across functions lines of business and external partners using systems that share data and insights collaboration that extends beyond a company s firewalls it is critical that data governance privacy and security measures receive the attention and investment required to protect the security and privacy of sensitive data establishing a central data office can serve to implement these controls on security privacy and data sharing while taking responsibility for complying with an ever changing regulatory landscape for example mapping data privacy classifications with specific data supply chains and the analytical outputs supported by them allows visibility into which parts of the data landscape are exposed to what type of user base the details of this mapping exercise can become the basis for privacy and security controls assembling these five elements in a stepwise holistic manner can have a great impact on any organization monsanto illustrates the benefits of sharing data and analytics expertise across functional boundaries to increase revenue and improve profitability the billion agricultural and biotech company launched a cloud analytics platform it calls science scale the platform helps the company s data experts and scientists collaborate and it has accelerated the development of analytics driven decision models says cio james swanson and because the platform enables scientific work to be done in hours rather than months the company estimates it has saved million in operating costs and boosted revenue by million this principle is applicable across all major industries establishing a central data office can serve to implement these controls on security privacy and data sharing while taking responsibility for complying with an ever changing regulatory landscape the democratization of analyticstoday companies that wish to excel at analytics are largely dependent on people with advanced analysis capabilities to manage data create algorithms and take other steps to turn data into insight however this is inadequate in the current dataabundant environment data is growing so fast that hiring and training enough analytics experts to keep up with the onslaught of information is realistically impossible depending on a core of analytics experts inevitably will create bottlenecks preventing an organization from scaling its use of data instead companies must democratize analytics with data tools available to people with varying degrees of analytics expertise at all levels of the organization companies today have numerous people without phds in statistics or data science but who have deep familiarity with customers and business processes in many enterprises they are an underutilized resource in generating insights from data rectifying this gap requires both training and new technologies some of which are already available that make analytics technologies simpler and more accessible crowdsourcing is another way to overcome internal skills shortages in analytics companies like netflix and procter gamble have held online crowdsourcing contests that ask people outside their organizations for help in solving technical challenges applications of data intensive vr virtual reality technology can make complicated data sets comprehensible to technicians and even customers lowe s the large home improvement retail chain in the u s is experimenting with vr headsets to help customers choose from a vast array of possibilities for a kitchen remodel elevator manufacturer thyssenkrupp is using microsoft s hololens to visualize an elevator repair before the technician reaches the site onsite technicians can use augmented reality ar to view digital overlays of manuals and repair guides while they fix the elevator 30the pathway to an age of abundance depends on subtraction and addition removing human beings from the data preparation process while augmenting human beings so they can more effectively use that data the pathway to an age of abundance depends on subtraction and addition removing human beings from the data preparation process while augmenting human beings so they can more effectively use that data overcoming barriers to capitalizing on analyticsto take advantage of the insight economy companies need to avoid several pitfalls above all the organization needs to master change capitalizing on analytics demands a complete overhaul of the organization s culture at every level it s a matter of moving from intuition to decisions based on data of getting comfortable with managing robots and learning to accept what they tell you line managers need to grow comfortable acting on analytics as do senior executives this transition is challenging and requires a comprehensive change management effort business users require education and practice in using tools and the products of data analysis they must learn that data can show correlations about business trends that are more precise and actionable than their gut instincts because these users bring great resources of institutional knowledge the training is well worth the investment training should continue as the company s analytics maturity advances for example when a firm implements more technologies to automate analytics production that will require users to adjust and carry out more advanced tasks becoming a data driven organization requires coaching and practice too everyone in the company needs to understand the importance of the effort and their role in its success to ensure that the transformation is successful employees need to embrace idea that the company s data is not owned by any one function but that all share ownership and responsibility for making good use of it in some organizations those who led data efforts in recent past such as the cio or chief data officer now need to collaborate extensively with other functions to make the best use of their singular expertise in particular data and analytics experts must work with domain and contextual experts to maximize the benefits of analytics this will democratize the use of data and the creation of business value from it data management and ownership issues can pose major internal barriers to analytics adoption data that is held captive and not shared across the organization can impede progress on the other end of the spectrum companies can also struggle with an excess of data choices executives need to evaluate options and prioritize the best uses of the data their organizations possess hiring developing and retaining analytics and ai talent is another initiative vital to analytics success to do this companies need to be aware of what motivates these professionals who may quickly become the organization s most valuable assets data privacy and security should also concern any organization embarking on a data driven analytics transformation organizations need to set up systems and appoint individuals responsible for ensuring customer consent and other elements of regulatory compliance in pursuing the opportunities posed by analytics the company must attend to the growing body of data privacy statutes and anticipate regulatory changes both the european union s general data protection regulation gdpr which went into effect in may and california s recently enacted consumer privacy act cpa which will take effect in include strict provisions and prescribe heavy fines for violations data security meanwhile requires extra attention when a firm stores data in the cloud and executives must ensure their analytics work accounts for this these regulatory statutes apply to organizations doing business in their jurisdictions and processing the personal data of their residents regardless of where the businesses may be headquartered companies should continue to monitor regulatory environments in all areas of the globe where they do business and ensure they thoroughly understand how their data is being used while planning for future statutory developments clearly implementing analytics just as with any technology is not a panacea for every business problem in addition to selecting the right technologies and tools success requires a commitment to culture change investments in skills and revamping business processes implementation and the transformation it produces is about people and processes as well as technology first steps toward the insight economythe insight economy is available to any organization that seizes the opportunity this starts with assessing your data capabilities the maturity of your enterprise s data collection data management and analytics capabilities then it s a matter of determining the best course of action that means deciding which parts of the business which functions and which business models would benefit most from the application of intelligence automation agility and the cloud leaders today need to make the mission clear to liberate data from its silos and unleash their workforce to gain crucial new insights and move their firms forward the data and expertise are abundant the

62,at a time of rampant digital disruption ceos are under enormous pressure to up their games virtually every industry is entering or already well into the early innings of major technology fueled transformation companies in turn are tasked with adopting innovative technologies bringing in tech savvy talent entering new markets and overhauling business models given the difficulty of delivering such seismic change organically more and more are recognizing that deal making capability is an increasingly critical key strategic tool in fact percent of ceos are considering some kind of merger acquisition or divestiture activity in the next three years according to results of a recent study conducted by chief executive and tata consultancy services tcs the top two drivers of deals acquiring new products or services and entering new markets creating new business models c suite executives gathered for a recent roundtable discussion on m a activity echoed those survey findings noting that while companies once pursued acquisitions to realize economies of scale or edge into new turf buying into business tech transformation is the leading deal making rationale today for us m a activity is about seeing the future said mark mlotek chief strategic officer at henry schein who described an evolution in his company sacquisition strategy over the past years we ve done about acquisitions during that period we did1 which was about scale we did which was geographic expansion we did which was product oriented and now we re doing which is digital the sheer magnitude of the changes afoot coupled with the pace with which they must be pursued is driving deals aimed at jumpstarting transformation such as walmart s acquisition of jet and cvs s deal with aetna we re moving from vertically oriented industry constructs toward more of a horizontal orientation where value creation has no regard for industry boundaries said frank diana leader of the future of business at tcs whodescribed a broadening of ecosystems think connected car smart home smart city as these ecosystems evolve there are opportunities for companies to monetize on a number of levels… the shifts that are coming requirecompanies to have a portfolio of innovations and m a is a way to drive those innovations and that portfolio at the same time deals are notoriously difficult to do well and even harder to ace at the speed demanded by today s competitive pressures all too often hoped for synergies go unrealized as newly coupled entities grapplewith the challenges of integrating operations including dissonant cultures and incompatible processes and platforms such was the case for hhhunt corporation where the company s first foray into m a growth was bumpierthan anticipated we struggled because our culture is our brand and the other company s culture just didn t fit ours recounted coo dan schmitt looking back we probably didn t do our homework how then can ceos assess opportunities and position their companies to succeed in deal making endeavors diligent preparation and orchestration across a deal s lifecycle can go a long way toward skirting the hurdles thattypically plague transactions agreed m a veterans several of whom shared strategies gleaned from experience you need to be disciplined asserted mlotek there are plenty of exciting opportunities to chase but you need toresist chasing the wrong opportunities or the right ones where the price is too high tom harrison who steered more than acquisitions during his tenure as ceo and chairman of omnicom reported that culture was as crucial as finances in his evaluations of potential acquisitions chemistry was incrediblyimportant to me he said i would always say if you re not the kind of person that i want to go to dinner and abroadway show with chances are we aren t going to get along and this isn t going to work the culture componentfor harrison who sought companies where the management would remain on board and be engaged post integration walking the halls and talking with employees was as central to the due diligence process as pouring over financial ledgers seeking companies that would take omnicom in a new direction add to its client base or deepen its competencies he vetted each potential target for entrepreneurialism walking in and talking with the receptionist and the employees really gives you a feel for a company s dna he said dave jordan global head and managing partner of tcs consulting services integration seconded that sentiment i call that the barbecue test would i want them to come to the home and enjoy a beer and barbecuewith the family he explained i drive some of my clients crazy because i insist on a significant emphasis on socializing during the due diligence process jordan urged ceos not to neglect this often overlooked component of m a success get away from the spreadsheet and spend time over dinner golf and other events so you really get to know one another he advised takingthe time to build a relationship and test the chemistry is really critical because at the end of the day if you don t like each other it isn t going to work while compatibility is essential cultural differences aren t always an issue noted mlotek who says henry schein draws a distinction between values and culture values are immutable they re not up for discussion he said but culture can cut both ways so we try to separate the two while all of the companies acquired by the healthcare product and services distribution company must share a commitment to its core values many continue tooperate as separate divisions we run p ls with separate boards where people feel empowered and have decision making authority within their divisions mlotek said adding that the degree to which acquired companiesneed to be integrated with existing operations often depends on the strategy behind the deal when it s about scale you integrate when it s geography you don t while bringing acquisitions into the fold can be tricky companies that regularly acquire for scale or geographic expansion generally develop and refine a process over time pointed out kathleen camilli an independent directorwith unifirst we do eight to ten acquisitions a year usually of mom andpop enterprises where the family that owns the company is looking to cash out she said we put in new equipment digitize everything and fold theminto our operation we rarely have any problems in cases where the purpose is to acquire an inventive product or the capacity for agility however integration without assimilation is often the challenge large organizations hoping to gain an entrepreneurial or innovationedge by acquiring younger companies often do so only to find themselves unable to nurture let alone adopt the very qualities that attracted them we ve seen acquisition as a way to inform the whole only work in limited cases said rob biederman founder and ceo of catalant who reported that skepticism about how integration would play out led his company to passon six potential deals the idea that something that is one one thousandth of the size of our company is goingto come in and make us more entrepreneurial more digital or more nimble it usually doesn t work because the body rejects the transplant we ve seen the things that made that small company great eventually get beatenout of it the good people leave and the positive impact just doesn t happen those who ve honed their approach to acquisitions into a core competency however say there are ways to overcome that challenge it comes down to how receptive the acquirer is to the acquisition said harrison in our casea lot of the small digital acquisitions really did change the way we thought and did business even though they were literally a fraction of our size we set out to acquire the right companies and we allowed them to influencethe way we did business in fact managed well the acquisition process can be a cultural win win added jim reagan cfo of leidos whose company merged with lockheed martin s information systems global solutions unit in a reverse morris trusttransaction that created a billion entity the lockheed culture that had been developed over decades had a little bit more structure than we had at leidos said reagan who reported that the combined company was able to work with consultants to develop a brand new culture in the process the two separate companies identified their differences but when we said what do we want to be everyone agreed we wanted to come in somewhere in between on cultural dimensions like structure and the degree of regimen to put around policies driven from the topone big factor in developing a successful approach to acquisition strategy and integration added mlotek is leadership acquisitions are hard and there is a natural tendency to reject them he said you need a ceo who is bold who understands where the future is going and who pushes the company it requires giving people some independence so they re not just subsumed and a leader who is willing to spend time connecting the dots on even the small things that leadership component is even more critical at a time when so many transactions involve acquiring technical capabilities or moving companies into adjacent businesses the success rate of transactions i d imagine is probably lower when it s about acquiring technology as opposed to scale noted dave brous president of dental apac and specialty solutions at henry schein acquisitions that bring a business into an adjacent space or redefine it as a multi industry player involve a whole different level of risk than gobbling up smaller competitors agreed tcs frank diana there s significant risk inherent to any proposition that expands a company out of its primary industry into other areas and that can be hard for stakeholders to embrace he noted you re looking at the future and you re seeing a potentialpath for future value creation or a value proposition but it s all brand new stuff that an organization may have trouble absorbing however failing to incorporate m a in a company s transformation roadmap is just as risky if not more so than the potential for an acquisition stumble agreed several ceos who cited dangers like being displaced by more aggressive peers or innovative upstarts in a lot of spaces if you re operating at the billion plus scale it s almost impossible to do meaningful development of new products said biederman sometimes there s just no other way to do it in fact embracing acquisitional risk may well be a competitive imperative you have to redefine that risk as opportunity said harrison because you re either going to stay in this lane and still be in it in five years or you re going to have a vision of what this new marketplace is going to be and acquire one of the adjacencies to take your business from here to there ultimately creating a competitive advantage in an era of uberstyle disruption means moving beyond simply talking about adopting transformative technology to actually using it to manifest a reimagined and sustainable enterprise increasingly ceos are recognizing the advantages of buying rather than attempting to build their way into closing business gaps the most effective ceos understand not only the need to embrace innovative processes systems and business models but the role m a can play in accelerating that process said tcs diana at the end of the day continuously and optimally capturing value from mergers acquisitions and divestitures should be a part of every ceo

63,introduction for finance executives the digital transformation isn t coming it s already arrived or they need to act as if it is anyway while their companies may still be working on prioritizing and procuring the necessary technology cfos need to make sure that the organization s future shape can accommodate and maximize emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things in their evolving role as strategists they must prematurely visualize a reconfigured finance function one that seamlessly aligns advances in technology with the acquisition of newly critical skills the task of rethinking the function even in the face of fast moving high impact technological changes doesn t require cfos to abandon their methodological ways they can t begin to reconstruct the function without first laying the supporting groundwork how to go about doing so is discussed in the chapters that follow which reflect the results of a survey conducted by cfo research in collaboration with tata consultancy services that explored many different aspects of digital maturity and leadership even as they steer the finance function into the unfamiliar terrain of the future cfos must make sure that it can withstand the challenges what finance leaders need to do includes modernizing the function to business making the shift to digital technology chapter adopting a machine first model aligning human skills and technological advances to support digital growth chapter becoming catalysts for growth actively adopting strategies technologies and agile business models chapter as their role shifts from record keepers to emissaries from the digital future senior finance executives will inevitably become both explorers and innovators chapter one finance chiefs redefine the art of possible with business 0business is poised to dive into an immersive digital future powered by a convergence of innovative technologies the cloud mobile robotics and artificial intelligence ai among others that will require finance executives to rethink every aspect of their businesses to thrive in this fast changing era companies will have to do more than retrofit existing processes to accommodate new technology the challenge of business is to leverage the digital shift to transform and grow companies that cannot successfully integrate technology embedding it throughout their business from the supply chain to the customer experience to operational processes risk quickly becoming commoditized no longer is it enough to acquire and implement advanced technological capabilities in business the marketplace leaders will be those companies that identify how best to integrate new technologies to deliver added value with the accelerating inflow of emerging technologies like blockchain and the internet of things maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage requires developing the capacity to continually drive digital capabilities the goal to produce visible benefits in both performance metrics and financial results no matter what industry they operate in most companies have by now embarked on digital initiatives but as they sort through the technical issues they must also confront the managerial challenges of allowing and enabling digital innovation to scale allocating resources recruiting and incentivizing talent that will drive technical advances as well as aligning functions such as marketing and product development for finance leaders the new digital mandate requires that they make strategically selective investments balancing leading edge technologies with those that are sufficiently mature and reliable to produce the desired benefits no sooner have companies absorbed the cloud and cybersecurity into their infrastructures then they must immediately begin incubating newer arrivals why the urgency in its comparatively brief but memorable history the phenomenon known as disruption has repeatedly rumbled through established industries and architectures hollowing out legacy business models before established market leaders had time to react by the time a brand name company like blockbuster recognized that it was being disrupted by netflix its market cap had utterly unwound the disruptors gain competitive advantage from crafting their business models around a vision of the future of digitization the new incumbents got where they are by conceptualizing their business models in alignment with the digital experiences they sought to deliver uber doesn t own any cars but is the largest cab company in the world similarly amazon doesn t hold any inventory but manages one of the world s most successful online retail sites connecting the consumer with the seller on a unique platform and configuring logistics to meet consumer needs while surpassing their pricing expectations for their companies to thrive in the digitized economy cfos need to become scouts exploring future technologies and piecing together a vision of the end state business model with that blueprint as their guide they then must help map out a route for how the company will arrive at the desired outcome more than managers cfos must become leaders who can persuasively communicate the purpose of the digital shift and empower the company s employees to contribute for starters however cfos need to focus on evaluating their businesses around six specific capabilities constructing the pillars of a digital strategy by addressing weaknesses and leveraging strengths analytics and measurement is the business gathering the information required to support timely decision making are big data and machine learning tools which add automation and improve the process of extracting insights from massive datasets integrated into analytics processes does management have complete real time visibility into cash flow is the organization leveraging analytics to instantaneously negotiate pricing and deliver a superior customer experience agility and efficiency does the organization possess a nimble infrastructure infused with agile methodologies that enables it to adjust to market changes quickly and perform its functions cost efficiently is the business using robotic process automation and cognitive processing to extend the reach of automation business architecture is the organization reaping the benefits of digital ecosystems having embarked on rethinking structures and processes from the ground up to position itself for growth is the business architecture streamlined and integrated optimized to exploit the promise of digital transformation governance risk management and compliance ifor cfos the migration to the cloud has created new concerns about the growing incidents of cyber hacking are there additional steps the company should take to protect sensitive data and intellectual property is the organization doing enough to balance expansion and cost reduction aims with maintaining compliance and mitigating risks associated with new regulations like gdpr general data protection regulation and new standards like ifrs international financial reporting standards shared services bpo the shared service landscape has been dominated by the low risk and high speed lift shift method of moving existing processes to a centralized location but as the finance function becomes better acquainted with ways to drive their own efficiency and effectiveness cfos need to consider whether the company should instead be applying digital capabilities to boost process efficiency conversely is there any way for the organization to derive more value from its shared service centers sscs should the business broaden the scope and sophistication of the processes it moves to the sscs can finance use some of what it has learned from its own experience with digital technology to apply those lessons to optimizing the performance of processes organizational alignment beyond the implementation of digital tools achieving transformation requires the imposition of a collective mindset that emphasizes collaboration and communication depending on the company the finance leader will have to identify a structure that best aligns business goals with digital strategy centralization de centralization hub spoke the shape of the organization to come must be rewired to bypass traditional silos and unite the organization in a shared commitment to risk innovation and investigation the survey aiming for a speedy recoveryto see how far cfos have come on this path and where they are going next cfo research in collaboration with tata consultancy services tcs recently conducted an online survey of senior finance executives in the u s and europe as part of the survey senior finance executives rated their finance function s current see figure and future within months performance on the six capabilities identified as key building blocks to adopting business – making the digital shift to transform and grow respondents used a point scale with as the lowest score the aggregate ranking shows an intent for modest improvement currentfuturegovernance risk management and compliance3 928analytics and measurement3 754agility and efficiency3 743business architecture3 730organizational alignment3 719shared services bpo3 567however given that many respondents have already achieved strong competency in each of the areas the analysis which follows isolates respondents who chose a lower tier score or for their current state for each of the questions to see where when and why key investments are likely to take place among those who assigned their finance functions lower rankings a sizeable proportion more than and as many as declared their intention to raise themselves from those basement tiers within months on the digital battlefield the speed at which companies differentiate and keep differentiating themselves is a potent weapon finance executives have clearly gotten that message perhaps from observing how quickly corporate titans can be toppled among respondents who ranked themselves in the lower tier related toanalytics and measurement plan to move out of the lower tier within months in their responses finance executives see clear value in leveraging business intelligence ifrs big data and machine learning high level analytics and the tools that enable it are increasingly seen as required capabilities by cfos nearly as many respondents who ranked themselves in the lower tier related toagility and efficiency plan to reach higher ground within months respondents see clear value in being customer centric and cost optimized and in leveraging rpa and cognitive processing a finance function cannot be agile if it is not efficient and those key tools among others drive efficiency a similar proportion of respondents who ranked themselves in the lower tier related tobusiness architecture plan to head north within months respondents see clear value in having a streamlined integrated architecture an inefficient business architecture constrains the organization limiting the value that it can deliver about half of respondents who ranked themselves in the lower tier related togovernance risk management and compliance plan to vacate the lower tier within months respondents see clear value in ensuring that these core responsibilities of finance and the cfo are well controlled lack of control in any of these areas can cause profound problems for the enterprise as cfos are all too aware slightly less than half of respondents who ranked themselves in the lower tier related toshared services bpo plan to depart that neighborhood within months respondents see clear value in leveraging centralized shared services and robotic processes cfos feel that they must ensure that both cost savings and efficiency are maximized in this area the smallest proportion of respondents who issued lower tier rankings but expect improvement in the next months were those clustered aroundorganizational alignment respondents see clear value in having an integrated centralized organization cfos feel that a distributed organization leaves finance exposed to operational inefficiencies and susceptible to spending that is less visible and therefore less disciplined than it would be in a centralized organization the cfo willing and ready to assume a new roleunderstanding existing capabilities can be as important as having a vision for future capabilities such information helps in formalizing the execution plan for an integrated strategy it is equally vital to know how effective the cfo is in emboldening the organization to pursue the less than linear path to digital transformation inaction is not an option as part of the survey respondents addressed the issue of whether their finance function can effectively engage on digital topics sponsor digital initiatives and move the organization to the desired level of digital competency a strong majority of respondents agree that their finance leadership can effectively display such skills fostering company wide adoption by leading the way however in many organizations the structure tools and culture don t fully support the cfo as a catalyst for growth in the respondent ranking of how well core elements of their finance organization effectively support a catalyst cfo enterprise technology finished well down the list this points to a clear opportunity for improving how finance can support growth if systems do not support growth there will be no growth see figure a transformed mindsetcfos understand that adopting business and making the digital shift is essential to transforming and growing the organization the drive toward digital transformation is reshaping their work along with everyone else s cfos must juggle the twin challenges of keeping the existing business growing while simultaneously reinventing it by effectively adopting and combining technology in innovative ways they can use the continuous supply of real time insights to fuel the company s competitive advantage as they drive new efficiencies cfos must also keep mitigating the risks that accompany the growth of the digital economy and ensure compliance with changing regulations as they adjust to the view from their new perch in the company s analytic engine room finance executives need to develop the know how to provide guidance regarding the emergence of new competitive threats the existence of any impediments to business growth and finance effectiveness and the hype free definition of what it means to provide effective leadership in the era of digital transformation mirroring the ongoing advancements in technology the skillsets of finance leaders will continue to broaden and deepen as they strive to master the digital landscape the value that cfos offer the business will also shift from their traditional role as record keeping advisors to their emerging position as forward thinking digital strategists chapter to support digital growth finance chiefs adopt a machine first modelas much as the oncoming wave of digital technology may increase the speed of corporate decision making senior finance executives can t allow themselves to be rushed when formulating a clear and comprehensive strategy for building a more agile organization digital transformation represents a new direction for the business as well as a transition for the cfo who must now help architect a cultural shift that focuses on enterprise wide outcomes rather than narrow individual goals in addition to tracking cost effectiveness senior finance executives must serve as proponents of cultural change promoting an environment that supports real time decision making and collaboration with investments in technology that dissolve data silos and enable data sharing it s up to the cfo to align technology with culture prioritizing investments that will serve to construct an ecosystem that can support the shift from a traditional structure to a fully digitized operation amid the digital transformation senior finance executives must straddle two worlds keeping one foot planted in economic reality while the other is submerged in fast rising pools of data which must be mined for predictive insights that can form the foundation of an emerging strategy while managing the roi their companies are realizing from technology investments cfos need to identify and install the people and processes that will also help the business maximize the value it gets from embarking on an ambitious digital transformation while senior finance executives don t have the luxury of adopting a wait and see posture they must carefully identify pockets where digital technology can produce revenue growth as tidy as the phrase may sound digital transformation carries different meanings for different kinds of business initially digitization efforts mostly applied to new marketing and distribution channels next digital products and services emerged then came vast ecosystems as embodied in companies such as amazon now as technologies like artificial intelligence and robotic process automation arrive in the marketplace digitization can also be applied to processes where human labor is combined with automation by adopting a machine first model for delivery finance executives can seamlessly merge human and machine effort to sharpen business differentiation depending on the sector a company s most viable path to transformation may be to prioritize a single area such as the supply chain while cfos must act boldly they needn t start as broadly as possible not every business is destined to be the next google or amazon creating heretofore unseen entities by shooting ripples of disruption across multiple industries by applying a mix of digital technology and matching talent to the company s most persistent pain points cfos can uncover a payoff in the form of increased efficiency and agility reaching that point however often requires that cfos lead the business through the early stages of coming to terms with the magnitude of the digital revolution at first there may be an institutional lack of willingness to confront the impact of the new technologies despite a watchful acknowledgement of their existence the next stage is characterized by confusion brought on by the overwhelming multitude of investment opportunities and directions with the growing awareness that digital technology will fundamentally change operations and rewire decision making cfos must winnow the options down to a strategy that suits the company aligning with the capabilities it either possesses or is well positioned to acquire models of maturitythe survey conducted by cfo research in collaboration with tata consultancy services set out to evaluate the maturity of an organization s digital leadership as a framework the survey used a maturity assessment model that ranks leadership on its ability to accept accountability for digital initiatives to enable the technology to saturate the business and to achieve clearly defined goals digital technology if managed wisely offers opportunities for companies to creatively re invent themselves and their operating models as finance executives rebalance their responsibilities moving away from traditional finance activities and toward providing strategic leadership the source of their value to the business also shifts they apply their financial acumen to driving value by allocating resources that will contribute to organizational transformation and technology implementation in the survey senior finance executives rated their function s performance both current and future along four different dimensions of digital competency see figure the four areas which are vital to creating a finance function that supports growth in a digitized organization are digital strategy as owners of the budgeting process as well as decision makers regarding any subsequent reallocation of resources cfos need to inject discipline into those areas setting measurable objectives in terms of both funding and outcomes without clear plans and targets whether assessing return on investment or calculating revenue growth a digital strategy can be reduced to nothing more than a passing hunch digital leadership by building accountability into the digital business strategy as well as fostering and modeling a new focus on innovation and experimentation finance executives can help transform the enterprise at its core rather than plastering a digital façade on the existing enterprise a digitally transformed enterprise requires leadership that is practiced and confident in the use of digital tools any gains derived from technology can be lost when the cfo is seen as a reluctant adopter or bystander business structures ecosystems and culture respondents are revealing their strong awareness of the central role collaborative eco systems play in enhancing competitive advantage and weathering business model disruptions to thrive as digital enterprises organizations must identify and provide the necessary support implementing a consistent and relevant set of practices from designing the right talent mix to continually tweaking the operating model digital enablers for cfos to become digital leaders they must implement such integrated capabilities as data analytics to equip the business to explore the digital frontier just as they need to broaden their aptitude to accommodate their emerging role as business technologists becoming fluent in everything from it architecture to talent development cfos must align their function s capabilities to suit the latest technology a critical component of success in the digital age many survey respondents ranked their companies as having already achieved strong competency in each of the areas planning for incremental improvement in the future currentfuturedigital strategy3 625digital leadership3 594business structures ecosystems and culture3 565digital enablers3 point scale where 1=low and 5=high current investments in digital transformationcfos have already begun making resource allocation decisions that reflect their expanded role as business strategists intent on making decisions that will fuel digital success when it comes to directing spending toward digital transformation initiatives the survey found that of respondents are devoting at least of their current finance budget to such plans an additional are devoting at least of their current finance budget to digital transformation initiatives senior finance executives are also well aware of the key role that employees play in accelerating digital transformation in the survey of respondents are devoting at least of current finance fte time to digital transformation initiatives and are devoting at least of current finance fte time to digital transformation initiatives by following the core principles of the machine first delivery model both employees and technology will continue to grow more digitally dexterous uniting to drive the company toward making unparalleled gains in a multitude of areas future investments in digital transformationhaving embraced the potential of digital technology to reshape their businesses finance executives are planning to continue driving the adoption of digital capabilities in the year ahead see figure among survey respondents plan to increase their total spending on digital transformation initiatives by at least in their budget next year a third of respondents anticipate boosting their total spending on digital transformation initiatives by at least in their next year budget interestingly the high performers are committing to investing the most in digital transformation more than three quarters of industry leaders scoring plan to increase their total spending on digital transformation initiatives by at least in their next year budget they are under no illusions that their hard won place among the digital elite is secure slightly more than half of respondents say they plan to increase their total fte time spent on digital transformation initiatives by at least in the next months a smaller proportion expect to increase their total fte time spent on digital transformation initiatives by at least in the next months once again among the industry leader segment plan to increase their total fte time spent on digital transformation initiatives by at least in the next months interestingly it appears that digital technology sells itself the more companies drink in digitization the thirstier for it they seem to become it appears that respondents who have embarked on transforming their businesses digitally feel validated in continuing to follow that path the imperative to improveby focusing on cautious follower respondents who selected a lower tier score for their company s current status in each area of digital competency the results provided unique insight into the urgency senior finance executives bring to extracting value from digital technologies and organizing their businesses to foster innovation of respondents scoring planning to improvedigital strategy39 digital leadership33 business structures ecosystems and culture42 digital enablers41 within each category up to of respondents who graded their companies on the lesser tiers expressed an urgency about making tangible improvements within the next months they clearly understand the dramatic benefits that can result from reshaping the finance operating model they can also measure the path to reaching and staying at the top as revealed by survey respondents conclusion digital cfo as masterful problem solverto conquer the digital domain finance executives must take on much more than performing economic analysis not only do they need to become business strategists but they also must develop into sophisticated problem solvers who can span multiple technologies and figure out ways to scale delivery models to capture new opportunities given the rate and breadth of technological innovation in areas ranging from cybersecurity to devops cfos can t hope to master every technical discipline but they can cultivate an approach for applying new technological tools and addressing unfamiliar business challenges in the absence of developing such competencies they risk having their companies fall behind in the pursuit of digital transformation by making the right investments finance executives can position themselves as sources of analytic insight exploring how best to create value in a digitized economy the challenge they face after all is not strictly about choosing a strategy to drive digital technology they must be satisfied with nothing short of leading an enterprise wide revolution chapter to become catalysts for growth finance chiefs are actively adopting strategies technologies and agile business modelsas dazzling as digital technology can be it can never serve as a substitute for solid business strategy while brainy algorithms and meticulous data can be the raw materials from which senior finance executives will build a better competitive edge such advances by no means guarantee the emergence of a sophisticated and triumphant digital business model the push such tools offer however can get the strategic ball rolling within the finance function advances such as artificial intelligence and machine learning can shave time off rote tasks and ensure that employees are equipped with the necessary information to perform their jobs ultra efficiently as ai relieves their daily workflow of the time consuming burden of searching for transforming and collating data employees can allocate more of their efforts to creative and customer facing activities put another way automation can take over aspects of their work where humans offer little distinct proprietary advantage but such an arrangement must enable an overall re imagining of the company s business model as stewards of financial data and business partners with the ceo senior finance executives now play a unique role in conceiving and implementing business strategy their deep understanding of the business combined with their technical ability to turn all kinds of data into actionable plans positions them to help drive organizational behavior spreading the company s objectives throughout its constituent business units it s up to senior finance executives to translate any new corporate strategy into metrics and performance indicators that every employee whether part of an efficiency focused operational team or a customer oriented function fixated on sales effectiveness can grasp and embrace the new explainer in chief the cfo s part in the digital transformation represents the culmination of an ongoing overhaul in the role traditionally known for their adeptness at squeezing cost out of the function s transactional activities by championing such tactics as offshoring centralizing and re engineering business processes cfos have now been elevated to act as advisors and coaches to top management rather than simply allocating resources to new technology the most proactive finance executives now apply a business based perspective to assessing the potential of digital technology implementation must be grounded in achieving specific results and outcomes from driving better informed decisions to managing risk more effectively by consistently drawing a clear connection between strategy and financial performance they keep the company in alignment like technology the role of the cfo has expanded from being an enabler of growth to serving as a key component in a company s success fulfilling that role at a time when business architectures are rapidly evolving means becoming to borrow a skill often ascribed to former u s president bill clinton explainer in chief it s no longer enough for cfos to capture the company s condition by assembling traditional accounting metrics they now need to explain changes in the customer base and marketplace backed up by data they need to articulate the gap between how management currently sees the company and how it should be looking at the business even on the most fundamental level how the company does and will make money the shifts are seismic legacy businesses that were built around the efficiencies of mass production or mass marketing are now shifting toward structures centered on massive data relying on platforms that enable them to process and analyze information that can reduce their costs or improve the precision with which they target customers even a traditional old line manufacturer an automaker may find the source of its future profits less in products and more in services that depends of course on whether it defines itself as competing primarily with tesla or uber as a demonstration of how dramatically metrics have changed it s worth noting that uber recently reported a quarterly profit for the first time since its founding in tesla s success is a function of its capability when it comes to owning customers while cfos previously characterized performance using producer based metrics roi roa the path to profits is now often mapped out using customer oriented measures such as customer acquisition cost churn rate and lifetime value how can senior finance executives negotiate these monumental moves and where do they find themselves most challenged the survey findings reveal that their efforts to grow into flexible and future oriented finance leaders require them to overcome the inevitable growing pains rising to the challengesthe complexities senior finance executives say they are confronting reflect the exponential growth of transformative technologies the cloud and robotics to name just two as well as the strategic pressure they feel to adapt to such changes ahead of their competitors when asked to rank the biggest challenges facing finance leadership as their organization seeks to catalyze growth the most frequently chosen response is connecting new strategies with new revenues see figure when we look closely at this list of challenges however it reads more like a list of goals that would define success as a growth catalyst cfo these are the key tasks undertaken by the cfo of an agile enterprise a strong majority of respondents agree that their finance leadership can effectively sponsor digital initiatives that align the organization with its chosen growth path not surprisingly they view c level sponsorship as critical to their success the ceo and cfo along with the top leadership team need to agree as to what success will ultimately look like achieving such alignment typically begins with presenting a well articulated case for large scale transformation then implementing practices to track progress and benefits along the way cfos as catalystsstrategic cfos can take a broad range of actions to support growth unlike the compliance and control oriented activities they focused on in the past they now need to focus on implementing strategic high value components of a successful growth plan the most significant responsibilities they can assume in that regard include ensuring that data analytics are being used strategically as well as getting involved in the development of next generation business models e g business as part of the survey respondents ranked the most important actions that a cfo can take to become a catalyst for growth and indeed ensuring that technology supports innovation is at the top of the list see figure for the full list of key enabling growth actions as the list indicates senior finance executives need to be looking beyond their own function and into the broader organization as well as the business environment at large to develop effective strategic plans they must monitor the horizon for emerging and relevant developments expertise in digital toolsin the survey senior finance executives also strongly confirm that they need to use advanced tools to support smarter decision making and provide forward looking models such tools are critical to sophisticated resource management budgeting and forecasting and core functions as part of the survey respondents ranked the likelihood of using specific tools within the next months to support growth big data analytics headed the list see figure so it is clear from the survey that senior finance executives not only need to understand digital technology but they also must cultivate an outlook on how emerging technologies will affect strategy business models and customers a transformation of their ownthe transformation to a digital economy puts cfos in a pivotal position in the crowded corridor between fast developing new technologies and upstream business activities such as operations or customer service it s up to finance to find and spread unique insights into how the business can keep improving data driven decisions will ultimately reshape organizations by pushing them to focus on customer centric capabilities the transition to an agile operating model whether that means faster innovation or deeper cross functional collaboration will drive finance leaders to rethink business structures separating core from non core activities based on the capabilities that they ve determined matter most equipped with the right combination of digital tools and know how companies will be able to make fast changes to accommodate shifts in customer behavior competitive situations or economic conditions evolving business structures will be less organized around functional tasks such as it or sales and more about constructing a business platform that cuts across vertically siloed functions and facilitates the efficient use of customer centric data having reoriented their vision to take an end to end view of the enterprise the cfo will grow skilled at identifying the kinds of data and insights that should help shape and improve corporate strategy in addition to measuring the impact that digital transformation is having on the business senior finance executives will be employing advanced tools to actively deliver strategic value as they lead the transformation to digital technology senior finance executives will be converted into catalysts for keeping the enterprise growing conclusionby applying laser like commitment and focus to overcoming the challenges of fostering digital maturity finance executives ensure that their companies don t get sidetracked or lose sight of their organizational priorities no sooner will their functions acquire new technologies then the company will see results in the form of better productivity or decision making rather than spending their time manipulating data on spreadsheets finance executives will be developing improved insights and judgments informed by sophisticated analytics tools and they ll keep pushing future oriented initiatives driving to align today s finance function with the one they know will soon exist,back from the future how finance leaders can drive transformation
65,it s hard to avoid the term agile these days the concept is generating excitement and zealous supporters at big companies worldwide as it should since it s helped firms like ing bank amazon online music powerhouse spotify and tv content producer netflix to flourish in fact harvard business review that publishing mecca for management thinkers has devoted no fewer than eight articles to the topic since including a cover piece this year on how to use agile to create a truly flexible large organization agile has also been the topic of bestselling books includingthe lean startup and scrum more importantly some companies are using agile to upend the way managers at all levels make changes to their businesses changes that have made them faster to respond to customers and competitors leaner and more innovative however not nearly enough senior executives deeply understand agile that is limiting how far and wide agile methods are adopted in their firms in fact nearly nine out of professionals surveyed this year believe their business are not highly competent in agile practices we believe that a key reason is that top management relegates agile methods to the it function this practice increasingly will put their companies at risk to competitors that have embraced agile from top to bottom in this article i ll explain what i believe prevents most companies from fully embracing and thus mastering agile then i ll offer advice on how to overcome such hesitation where agile has gotten tractionfor agile s many proponents the slow embrace of it at the top of companies may seem hard to understand the adulation around agile has been building for years the concept emerged at the turn of the millennium when web based business and online ways of doing business in older companies were starting to take off suddenly many online businesses and processes were available to customers round the clock at the click of a mouse which greatly accelerated the speed of business to compete against the amazons netflixes and spotifys established companies had to learn how to develop new systems in weeks or months rather than years today some find they must update their systems and online processes weekly or even daily software developers realized that to compete in a digital world organizations needed to move beyond traditional development techniques such as waterfall or sequential approaches to address this of them wrote an agile manifesto in that reimagined software development to be faster more adaptive and more effective companies like amazon facebook spotify and google make dozens of changes to their web systems daily in contrast companies that use waterfall development may take months to make similar adjustments in the years since its inception agile has grown ever more dominant by of u s federal government software projects were agile or iterative research firm gartner predicts of large enterprises will adopt agile by still while agile has been embraced by software developers worldwide for many managers it remains a new or untried concept in fewer than half of organizations surveyed by the project management institute used an agile or hybrid agile approach over the prior months another study found that while most senior executives don t embrace agile the concept is usually highly effective in other parts of their organizations 5agile is particularly important for certain types of businesses especially those with digital products or legions of customers who buy their products online of course this includes companies like facebook google netflix and spotify but also banks newspapers and airlines the need for agile is less obvious yet still important in industries that rely on personalized digital marketing campaigns other industries where agile has taken hold include those that use self service websites in customer service usaa which offers insurance and other financial services to military families has more than agile teams and plans to add another in likewise netherlands based bank ing has assigned most of its fulltime employees to agile teams senior executive resistance to agiledespite agile s momentum and many documented benefits many senior executives have ignored it i have found three primary reasons for this skepticism incomprehensibility and career threats let s go into each one skepticism executives have seen years of corporate improvement programs before many have receded only to be replaced by new vital tools remember re engineering pay for performance and the balanced scorecard these have come and gone over time and seasoned executives inevitably have grown jaded they may see agile as the latest management fad a distraction to be resisted incomprehensibility agile brings a new and extensive vocabulary that executives must learn the large and growing list of agile terms includes scrum kanban devops lean minimum viable product mvp sprints extreme programming backlog grooming burndown charts burnup charts and the scaled agile framework while developers and agile teams have found these terms useful executives are likely to see them as opaque and off putting jargon career threats if you are accustomed to wielding power you could view the idea that teams manage themselves rather than being directed from above as subversive how does an executive justify her position and compensation if she delegates key decisions to those under her what distinguishes her from the rank and file employee there s also the fear of dispensing with pyramid style hierarchy and reorganizing into small agile squads particularly when managers are confronted with the thought of dozens of such squads running around to master agile however its proponents must help skeptical executives overcome their resistance agile management requires buy in not just from software developers but from the entire company managers at every level and in most business functions must embrace the new way of working a world in which competitors can make important changes to products services and processes in weeks or days or hours in the case of digital assets forces companies to dramatically accelerate key decisions and actions an ecommerce site that cannot promptly fix an interface that customers find frustrating will no doubt lose them to the likes of amazon whose agile teams constantly improve the customer experience and whose developers can implement multiple software updates each day the adoption of agile methods is also critical in industries whose physical products contain a growing digital component these include cars with telematics and onboard infotainment systems and aircraft engines power turbines and other industrial equipment which increasingly come fitted with sensors and predictive analytics agile methods are also now vital in industries where the customer experience is the product disney for example is improving the customer experience at its orlando fla theme park using agile management and extensive data collected from the magicband wrist bands that visitors wear over the next few years as more and more large enterprises reorganize into highly responsive agile teams the list of industries that must embrace agile will grow top managers who don t support and master agile methods will become problematic getting leadership buy infrom our experience in helping dozens of companies make the transition to agile we have observed three measures that can greatly improve the chances of success focus on the benefits not the approaches successful agile advocates present specific outcomes in dollars and cents they convince executives that it will improve operational performance and therefore help them before addressing how those results will be achieved showing executives the business impact of agile in financial and operational terms will greatly reduce skepticism look for stories like these deploying agile to save an oil services firm in oil services engineering and construction firm worleyparsons found itself in crisis with the price of oil plummeting demand for its services declined substantially successive rounds of cuts didn t solve the problem using agile squads sprints backlog prioritization and daily huddles the company attacked the cost base it implemented a wide range of changes from overhauling the it infrastructure to banning business class travel to accelerating responses to rfps to fixing inefficiencies in only days the firm increased its cash position in the first year it saved million on a billion cost base and margins increased by percentage points the equity markets noticed its stock rose fourfold building the world s most cost effective fighter jet executives who believe agile is better suited to a silicon valley startup than a complex organization should consider the gripen fighter jet s fuselage one of the world s most complex products saab aeronautics uses more than cross functional agile teams working in three week sprints to build the fuselage to promote efficiency the company has a daily process for identifying issues at a m each frontline agile team holds a minute meeting to flag impediments some of which cannot be resolved within that team at a m those impediments are escalated to a team of teams where leaders either fix them or further escalate issues this approach continues and by a m the executive action team has a list of the critical issues it must resolve to keep progress on track the result according to an influential industry publication is that the gripen has been dubbed the world s most cost effective fighter jet research has correlated agile management with strong results financial and otherwise some of finance executives reported revenue growth after adopting agile methods while only of non agile leaders reported growth according to a study by the american institute of cpas and the chartered institute of management accountants aicpa cima see figure practitioners of scrum the most popular agile methodology estimate the approach is successful of the time other research has shown that the agile methods can speed time to market by increase sales staff productivity and increase time spent on value adding activities such as innovation customer interaction and problem solving by describe senior management s new and important rolein addition to showing the benefits of agile its proponents must communicate the key role of top management in mastering agile this should reduce fears about the impact of agile on executives careers and status it also helps to describe the practices these leaders will need to stay effective the role of leadership in an agile organization is markedly different rather than making great decisions agile leaders help teams make great decisions rather than exercising authority based on rank experience and expertise leaders must treat people as equals and empower them leaders must shift the culture from one that doesn t permit mistakes and thus at its extreme operates on fear to one in which failures are tolerated lessons from those failures are celebrated and changes are put in motion rapidly 15in short the role of a leader in an agile organization is to create strategy and empower rather than micromanage senior leaders must establish guidelines that agile squads can apply and operate within for example the marketing department of a multinational oil and gas company developed parameters for social media campaigns focusing on controversial environmental issues after top management defined the campaign standards and objectives regional and local agile teams quickly tailored messages for their markets write your company s agile manifestothe final step is to write your own agile manifesto for your company s leaders both the c suite and the board unlike the agile manifesto of which focused on agile methods your agile manifesto must explore the potential business impacts of agile in revenue and profit and point to where this has already happened in similar companies competitors and others your messages must be clear speaking about agile in everyday terms will reduce its incomprehensibility to those who don t use the language every day avoid acronyms and use the vernacular of business not software for instance instead of using terms familiar to developers like servicesoriented architecture soa explain that the goal is to develop small pieces of software each of which focuses on a key business task you must liberally use real business examples to illustrate and prove the value of agile be sure to invoke the names of highly respected companies and well regarded ceos division heads etc who have become big proponents to get you started here are some examples netflix among its many accomplishments perhaps the most impressive is the rapid rise of its original content in just five years after launching house of cards netflix scored the largest number of emmy award nominations a distinction that had been held by hbo the previous years how did an upstart conquer a highly competitive established industry in so little time the answer fast feedback iterative changes and cross collaboration all core agile concepts instead of releasing pilots to see if a concept will work netflix tests and reviews projects under development to improve the chances its shows connect with audiences using agile techniques netflix also individualizes marketing campaigns the company produces multiple personalized trailers for programs and screens them with members based on data of their viewing habits these techniques have helped netflix rise to dominance the service is watched more than any other platform including basic cable and broadcast it released hours of original programming in the second quarter of up more than year over year 19ing bank like most banks does not have its roots in technology yet several years ago it foresaw the mounting threat from financial technology firms and recognized that agile methodologies made these startups more responsive ing reorganized itself into agile squads in which business it and employees collaborated constantly testing what they might offer our customers in an environment where there are no managers controlling the handovers and slowing down collaboration according to cio peter jacobs ing also did away with steering committees project managers and agility killing silos the results faster time to market stronger employee engagement and increased productivity rather than having five or six big online product launches per year the company goes live with new releases every two weeks or so that has helped ing deliver stellar online customer experiences 20nestle s digital acceleration team has used agile techniques to manage global social media for its brands the approach has enabled the company to scale up its social media presence across the world and increase followers to more than million consumers it has also driven company innovation as a result e commerce for nestle accounts for of sales 22amazon is arguably one of the most innovative companies ever not coincidentally it was built on agile and ceo jeff bezos pins the company s success on the concept in today s era of volatility he has said there is no other way but to re invent the only sustainable advantage you can have over others is agility that s it because nothing else is sustainable everything else you create somebody else will replicate like netflix amazon immerses itself in the data that its vast website generates it constantly tests new ideas both small and big hence prime fulfillment by amazon amazon web services aws amazon business as well as the occasional failure such as the fire phone despite the market dominance of its e commerce interface developers are constantly testing potential site updates to understand how consumers will respond the data these squads obtain helps ensure that new releases are successful and in rolling out new software amazon s nimbleness is unmatched in e commerce despite its complexity amazon has structured its software so it can make many changes to its website each day electric carmaker tesla is also built on agile techniques and is engineered to make change easy it created interfaces so that each component of its cars can be modified independently the bumper team can change its design so long as it maintains the interface with the parts it affects rather than waiting for waterfall style major releases the company makes about engineering changes each week to improve both production and performance 24why you need to start penning your agile manifesto todayagile is making a real difference in how managers and workers improve products and processes if top management at your company resists agile now is the time to write your own agile manifesto for them but be sure to make it a lively read grounded in facts and figures of agile s business impact at market leading companies your manifesto must be understood by the lay person not just by the agile advocates and it needs to clearly explain the vital role that senior management will play in an agile enterprise you can save the mechanics of how a scrum works for later after you win buy in at the top and after they see boost financial performance you ll be surprised how agile

66,as digital transformation takes hold across all industries company leaders must dramatically shift their thinking they are leaving a business world of constraints and entering an age of abundance of digital data and the technology tools to create innovations from that data every large company today is swimming in a rising tide of digital data that data resides in their information systems but it also resides in the ecosystem that surrounds them the data of suppliers distribution channel partners and others with which they do business the sources and types of data are rising at an exponential pace some of the world s digital data today has been created in the last two years alone by itself the u s produces an average of more than million gigabytes of internet data every minute a number that figures to increase as the world of connected devices grows soon people will be routinely talking about zettabytes trillion gigabytes of digital data a concept that would have been unfathomable only a few years ago as the world s population surges data will not only change companies and whole industries it will be the key to addressing societal issues like managing traffic growing food and feeding countries indeed it researcher international data corp idc predicts that by the end of this year half of large enterprises will be selling the digital data they generate in their businesses as well as metrics insights and recommendations on what to do with it 2for a case study in leveraging data effectively consider abb the billion industrial firm that services power plants and automates industrial processes the company credits its abb ability platform of services3 with driving an increase in orders for its software and services in the platform collects real time data analyzes and monitors conditions at industrial facilities such as factories oil wells and power plants to reduce operating costs and improve safety and maintenance abb estimates the platform offers the potential for billion in annual sales in the future 5while those prospects may be tantalizing other research indicates most enterprises are neither getting enough from their current data nor preparing themselves to tap into the new data that will soon be available 6there is plenty of technology and expertise today to help companies capitalize on their digital data but most of it goes untapped because there s a shortage of something else imagination in short too many companies lack the capabilities of generating insights from their data i e of creating profound new observations about what customers want why they buy what they like and don t like about a company s current offerings and the purchase and post purchase experiences they provide with their offerings and much more when companies are data rich but insight poor innovation suffers ideas for new products services and business processes are episodic and often off target widespread weakness a lack of data maturitythe root of this problem is clear to us these companies lack strong capabilities in analyzing data in a survey of organizations around the world gartner found that had not yet reached a transformational level of maturity in data and analytics despite this being the top investment priority for cios in recent years indeed of those surveyed rated themselves average or below average when it came to data maturity what exactly does it mean to lack maturity in data analysis people throughout an organization don t share data companies also don t take full advantage of the data that business partners collect what s more companies with immature analytics capabilities operate in data fiefdoms where pockets of insight generating analytics benefit only one part of the organization the experience of monsanto the billion agricultural and biotech company illustrates the benefits of sharing data and expertise across functional boundaries to increase revenue and improve profitability monsanto launched a cloud analytics platform it calls science scale the platform enables the company s data experts and scientists to collaborate and it has accelerated the development of analytics driven decision models says monsanto cio james swanson and because the platform enables scientific work to be done in hours rather than months the company estimates it has saved million in operating costs and boosted revenue by million becoming data and insight rich begins at the topthe minority of companies today that generate game changing insights from their digital data operate quite differently than the rest that difference begins at the top of the organization with a leadership team that worships digital data we call this having a data centric statement of purpose leaders believe analytics and data are the foundation of their company s digital transformation and that they are the source superior customer experiences and superior new product service offerings leaders then must determine exactly how the insights from both internal and external data can create new opportunities they need to first assess their organization s data maturity existing data inventory what the company should capture and analyze and then map out how to reach the target state this must include determining how valuable insights can be shared across the organization which often requires eliminating cultural barriers that prevent such sharing three sources of data to harvestin our work we found three sources of digital data that many companies don t fully tap ■ existing siloed data companies often have data that provides tremendous value to one business function such as marketing but is not shared with other functions that could gain similar value from it this data must be made available in digital form to be analyzed by anyone within the organization this is easier than it sounds disconnected data in u s and u k companies create waste duplications of efforts and missed opportunities according to a survey of it decision makers and business application users by market research firm vanson bourne nearly three quarters believe their organization is missing out on opportunities because of data silos more than half feel those silos are obstacles to meeting business objectives while believe disconnected data hampers innovation ■ missing internal data companies capture only a small percentage of the data from their operations data that is within their control companies that are insight rich typically collect data from their operations that competitors aren t capturing in their own businesses further many organizations outsource some of their business operations to third party vendors during such operations the service providers collect large volumes of data however vendors may not have a mechanism to make data effectively available to their partner organizations to take informed business decisions in addition these partners may not have advanced technologies to collect all relevant data points that have a bearing on customer experience for instance airline companies generally outsource the wheelchair operations to service providers who may not use internet of things iot or mobility solutions to manage the operations on a real time basis as a result airline companies may potentially fail to collect and analyze valuable data points which otherwise would have helped them positively address their customer experience initiatives or operational delays this principle is applicable across all major industries take for example the oil and gas industry in a hazardous environment such as an oil exploration site improving personnel and equipment safety is paramount therefore it is crucial to collect data that helps industry players improve processes makes more informed business decisions and manages safety maintenance and costs frequency of data collection will also play a crucial role in meeting the business objectives ■ new kinds of external data the data marketplace provides all sorts of information that properly used can create tremendous value the growing data brokerage industry which collects and markets data on consumers habits is expected to reach the billion mark in 10for example ride share and taxi services in india can identify the restaurants and establishments where people eat that data could be sold to other restaurants and businesses that want these people to buy their products and services the offers based on insights about customers dining histories and locations create opportunities to collaborate in an urban area digital ecosystem one that could enhance customer experiences and expand sales new data can come from unexpected places like washing machines consider wash multifamily laundry systems an el segundo calif based laundry facilities management service provider with locations in the u s and canada it collects a vast amount of data from its extensive network of hundreds of thousands of interconnected washer dryers vending machines and payment systems working with apartmentbuilding owners wash uses this data to model and test manager s questions such as whether it is cost effective to switch from cash to payment cards before committing to changes 11new types of public private partnerships are evolving in this age of abundant data the dutch capital of amsterdam uses gps data from mobile and navigation devices gathered by a private company to create models to study traffic issues in the city the possibilities that come from having almost limitless access to information are often just the constraints of imagination and will making data easier to usedigital data is not the only product that is abundant today so are people who can make sense of the data this may sound counterintuitive given an acute shortage of data scientists statisticians and other professionals sought by companies near and far to analyze big data companies today have numerous people without phds in statistics or data science but who have deep familiarity with customers and business processes in many enterprises they are an underutilized resource in generating insights from data today analytics are largely dependent on having people with advanced analysis capabilities to manage data create algorithms and take other steps to turn data into insight while this approach could work in the past when companies had smaller data sets and the pace of business was slower it is inadequate at a time when data is abundant to begin with data is growing so fast that hiring and training enough experts to keep up with the onslaught of information is impossible depending on a core of analytics experts creates a bottleneck it prevents an organization from scaling its use of data instead companies must embrace the democratization of analytics where data tools are used by people with varying degrees of analytics expertise at all levels of the organization it requires new technologies that make analytics simpler such as machine learning and new programming languages like python or quantum computing quantum computing has been the talk of the industry for some time now unlike current systems quantum computers are able to complete complex tasks at a fraction of the time consumed by contemporary processing systems this opens up new opportunities in terms of real time data processing consider a wealth management firm financial advisors rely on research to design investment plans for their high net worth clients as the process generally involves complex calculations traditional data mining solutions are used however lack of data processing in real time could potentially affect the revenue and hence the performance of the financial firm in such scenarios the firm can use quantum computing to process and analyze both structured and unstructured data to improve the client experience by for example providing both personalized service and rapid responses to customer questions about investments this capability makes the firm more agile better able to respond to market conditions and drive business growth farmers insurance is another example the insurance firm is using an ai platform called datarobot to bring machine learning techniques to a team that analyzes customer behavior and examines the designs of different insurance policies 13the second improvement is around data interfaces just as analytics technologies must be easier to use the democratization of analytics hinges on making the use of data simpler and more intuitive for example organizations could create models where people talk to an ai based system like amazon s alexa in which they verbally ask for and receive information they need new data presentation tools such as mixed reality and augmented reality ar can also help they present data in an intuitive visual manner this is already happening in many industries logistics company dhl tested smart glasses and ar in a warehouse in the netherlands workers guided through the warehouse by graphics displayed on the smart glass were able to speed the picking process and reduce errors boosting efficiency by 14lowes the large home improvement retail chain in the u s is experimenting with vr headsets to help their customers visualize furnishings for a kitchen remodel 15thyssenkrupp an elevator manufacturer is using microsoft s hololens to visualize an elevator repair before the technician reaches the site onsite technicians can use augmented reality to view digital overlays of manuals and repair guides while they fix the elevator 16this type of technology is extending to a vast array of purposes and industries ford is using virtual reality vr to create virtual models of cars and enable designers to better collaborate on design changes the technology reduces the need to build physical prototypes and allows the engineers to more easily explore creative designs cosmetics companies are testing their products by creating digital twins of animal skin so they can see the reaction to test products in a virtual environment without harming animals as these examples attests the pathway to the age of abundance depends on subtraction and addition removing human beings from the data preparation process while augmenting human beings so they can more effectively use that data overcoming the barriers to generating game changing insightsevery company today needs to determine how it will gain crucial insights from the vast and growing amount of digital data it can tap but the biggest barriers are not technological ones in fact they are primarily cultural liberating data so it can be effectively harnessed is largely a change management exercise that must account for the many ways and many reasons that data is not widely shared and used we have found five cultural barriers and one technology management hurdle to leveraging data in many organizations ■ data held captive departments can be reluctant to relinquish it for a number of reasons they are concerned that the information can be misused or tampered with the data sharing might also reveal mistakes such as a bank ignoring some regulatory rules to onboard customers faster the data sharing can also erase competitive advantages one business line may have over others that compete for the same customers ■ too many data choices companies have the potential to use vast amount of missing and external data as new sources of this data continue to emerge but it can be difficult to determine exactly which data will provide the most value ■ privacy concerns to fully make use of available data companies need to ensure they have proper consent following both privacy regulations and respecting consumer boundaries ■ poor data sharing processes some companies make the process of sharing data overly laborious and time consuming for example some banks even in developed nations require digital data to be printed out scanned and re entered which makes it difficult for employees to use the data in a timely way ■ lack of direction from the top accessing abundant data resources depends on an over arching perspective that can only be shaped through top down direction too often this direction is missing which reduces cross functional collaboration and creates data fiefdoms the technology management hurdle relates to cost optimization while the hyperbolic growth of data represents a great opportunity for companies to gain new insights the abundance of data also imposes a heavy burden on computation storage and communication in data centers task assignment data placement and data movement further influence the operational expenditure for business it is therefore important for leaders to be aware of this tension and to identify means for optimizing the benefits while making the best use of resources to minimize costs these barriers are not insurmountable but to overcome them company leaders must mandate that data be transparent and shared across the organization leaders today need to make the age of abundance a clarion call those who do will take an important first step to helping their organization liberate data from its silos and unleash their workforce to gain crucial new insights without being overly reliant on experts 1ifl science july accessed at futurescape worldwide analytics

67,in an era we call business digital technologies offer enterprises huge opportunities to create superior customer experiences leverage ecosystems and embrace risk it s no surprise then that digital transformation projects have become top of mind for executives at large organizations yet there is a raft of smaller but just as important corporate improvement initiatives that have become stalled or are being ignored companies shouldn t ignore them in part because they can free up investments for critical digital initiatives the problems that these improvement programs address most likely will sound familiar because most big companies have them daily perational headaches that are degrading and slowing operations costing customer goodwill and needlessly inflating internal spending what s more these bottlenecks can stand in the way of executing the strategies that c level leaders and board members are prioritizing in the era of digital disruption nearly every large company today can make operational improvements that will have a sizable impact strategically and on their top and bottom lines these issues affecting large and recurring costs can be found throughout most organizations in such areas as accounts receivable procurement order activation product enhancement the supply chain and the it function surgical improvements in these relatively neglected areas can yield major benefits even better when key leaders share the same goals and coordinate the resources required for these efforts they can make these operational tweaks quickly thanks to new automation tools in turn that allows and encourages the organization to re focus on the larger digital transformations it must make an investment with outsized returnsno company decides to build operational inefficiencies into its business processes they accumulate over time thanks to choices made about technologies investments market strategies and business unit wants and needs these choices often made as urgent problems arise rarely made holistically with a view to the future health of the entire organization start to add up ultimately resulting in increases in ongoing overhead worse they tend to thwart the flow of data and intelligence throughout the enterprise affecting not simply operational efficiencies but ultimately the quality of the customer experience delivered upon which the health of the organization depends the areas in which these operational issues exist say accounts receivable may generate great volumes of data that could have significant value for the enterprise but due to a variety of factors perhaps disconnected systems or political struggles over data ownership issues the data are often unavailable outside of departmental or functional silos limiting their usefulness to the enterprise a few years ago addressing such a disconnect and gaining access to siloed data would require implementing a new system at a great cost of time and money today fortunately there are new technologies that can solve the problem far more quickly and inexpensively enterprise leaders can take advantage of advanced analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities both to discover where operational inefficiencies exist and also to turn them around in many cases this does not require a huge overhaul of business operations companies can often fine tune their business processes and thanks to automation start seeing benefits in short order these efforts may not have the cachet of digital transformation initiatives but some companies have uncovered significant opportunities to generate more cash and sharply reduce costs on par with more disruptive transformation programs that require millions of dollars to launch and execute a much longer timeline for retrieving returns where the improvements liesome examples of organizations retrieving a large return on investment via incremental operational improvements include a telecom was able to dramatically reduce the time it took to get its new customers up and running transforming not only the speed and cost of order fulfillment but thereby its customer s experience in the company had a net promoter score of minus not surprising given its largely manual order fulfillment processes at the time in the situation quickly went from bad to worse when the local government mandated high speed internet access to every home and business by the deluge of service requests quickly became unmanageable with the average time to activate service stretching to an unforgivable days from moment of customer inquiry after analyzing the order fulfillment process the company found that reasons for the huge order fulfillment lag times were disintegrated systems and siloed operations in response it redesigned its order toactivate service process to create one case manager for each order the case manager operated as a single point of customer contact with sole accountability for the order at the same time the company consolidated ten different applications that were required to onboard a new customer into a single order intelligence platform by cycle time for order activation had been cut in half the cost to activate a new service dropped and the company s net promoter score more than doubled to a positive all told the company estimates that the effort will cut costs by approximately million over three years taking a closer look at accounts receivable processes can also improve cash flow for many organizations one billion steel manufacturer for example was facing declining demand many of its customers were delaying payment meanwhile the company was struggling to correctly register the payments of those customers whose accounts were current leading to disputes and increased overhead to accelerate cash flow the company developed an automated cash forecasting system which could analyze data from finance accounting and other departments the new system reduced disputes and increased collections by similarly a utility company improved cash flow by million and bad debt by million by implementing an algorithm that identified unbilled accounts which the company was able to cut in half in procurement identifying internal purchases that are non compliant with corporate purchasing agreements can turn up overlooked savings possibilities or uncover fraud inefficient purchasing often arises in global manufacturers when multiple factories purchasing products from the same suppliers fail to communicate to pool their purchases to take advantage of volume discounts today an increasing number of these companies are using software with artificial intelligence to scan purchase requests across multiple plants and vendors to better understand the behavior that drives purchasing price variances across plants by doing so they can see how much prices vary receive notifications of exceptions to purchasing agreements and flag purchase orders that look abnormal or indicate potential fraudulent activity one major oil company used such a system to flag transactions in six months achieving million in annual expense reductions another firm a global aluminum manufacturer discovered in potential savings after reviewing purchasing transactions with its suppliers similarly a major airline identified million a year in non compliant travel and expense purchases accounting for six percent of the airline s total t e spend the same principle of incremental improvement applies to other operational areas for example by better tracking assets companies can uncover and prevent inventory shrinkage from lost and stolen goods the it organization also can benefit from operational improvements one pharmaceutical firm used artificial intelligence to make its data center operations more efficient a banking investment firm employed ai software to reduce the time it took to resolve technology incidents by tweaks in marketing and sales processes can boost product innovation and generate new sources of revenue a large software company performed advanced analytics on its customer data to identify which customers were most likely to buy its products as a result the company dramatically improved the targeting of its marketing campaigns it also analyzed data on how customers were using its products and determined which features were critical and which were not that analysis guided its product development teams in designing new features and new products where to beginidentifying and implementing incremental improvements requires careful planning by taking the following four steps an organization can execute projects that optimize its return on investment find the important value chain s with high impacts on operating costs especially those that affect the customer experience important value chains vary by industry for a telecom company the customer acquisition process is foremost for a gas or electrical utility the most important value chain could be the meter to cash process which includes billing and accounts receivable identify key success metrics that when achieved will dramatically improve the organization s performance the metrics may be about the bottom line or customer satisfaction for utilities important metrics to track include the cost to serve each customer and the percentage of consumers using self service portals when analyzing metrics results companies must benchmark them against peers in the industry or organizations recognized as best in class across industries identify which business processes impact the key measures and map out how they work end to end using a tool like value stream mapping vsm a lean management technique that documents the entire value chain end to end reveals both strengths and weaknesses in a given process the vsm exercise clearly shows the hidden factories in a business process i e process steps where inefficiencies have accumulated over years it also shows how relevant data flows through the process and identifies bottlenecks that result in customer dissatisfaction establish a cross functional team whose members can evaluate where and how to improve key business processes that will enhance customer experience and or improve operational efficiencies this involves mapping the transactional data generated by a business process this data will be vital to analyzing the performance of that process consider a telecom company that collects demographic data on customers in the sign up process the company can use that data to sharpen its customer profiling and better target its marketing campaigns to cross sell and upsell customers for new services it can also track customer profiles over time collecting and analyzing data to predict churn the team also must assess which technology solutions to implement because there is a plethora of relatively low cost commercial off theshelf software available the team must carefully evaluate them on their expected benefits how long they will take to implement and their cost for example robotic process automation rpa is a cost effective solution to automate repetitive manual tasks in the back offices such reading data from a pdf file and entering it into a system and freeing up human talent to do more value added activities while these solutions do deliver efficiencies make transactions error free and can be easy to configure they are not suitable in companies that process many transactions and make frequent process changes the team s members including both stakeholders and subject matter experts are crucial to selecting the right set of technologies whether rpa analytics or ai that can provide sustainable results for the best roi successful companies typically constitute a center of excellence coe function headed by a senior leader often a c level executive responsible for approving these operational improvement projects and monitoring their execution the coe provides resources removes bottlenecks helps coordinate organizational silos to ensure that the projects meet the deadline and delivers promised benefits a near term imperativecompanies that want to leverage these opportunities must create alignment and consensus among c level leaders about operational improvement priorities and resource allocation they also need to have executive buy in for increased data sharing and operational automation and identify and prepare key data required for process improvement an automation what s more they must carefully evaluate robotic process automation tools and ai capabilities that can automate manual processes and improve efficiency cut costs and reduce errors finally they should use big data and analytics software to identify areas of rising costs or decreasing efficiencies sweeping digital transformation may remain the top priority for most large organizations over the long term however surgical operational improvements can deliver significant savings and revenue opportunities in the near term,unleashing business value in a business world
68,around the world companies are embarking on costly but crucial digital transformations their goal is to leverage new and still emerging technologies to provide a truly differentiated customer experience that will attract new customers retain old ones and drive revenue those that have had enterprise systems for years in order fulfillment and finance erp manufacturing and logistics supply chain management systems customer relationship management marketing sales and service human resource management and other cross functional processes have a big leg up in digital transformation they already possess the crucial enterprise applications upon which new digital systems such as wireless sensors embedded in products iot ai and analytics tools and other technologies must be built therefore enterprise systems are not going away if anything they are becoming more important to digitizing a business yet many businesses with enterprise systems face a decision whether keep the multimilliondollar enterprise systems they installed in their data centers a while ago the so called on premises versions or whether to update to the latest cloud based versions of them at a considerable expense in our view the answer to that question is simple it will largely depend on whether they will need the capabilities that the cloud based versions of their enterprise systems uniquely offer or not companies that won t need those capabilities for the foreseeable future we argue should continue to run and maintain their on premises enterprise applications however those that will need those capabilities should seriously consider when they will need to shift to the cloud versions most companies today are sticking with on premises enterprise systemsthe numbers reported by enterprise system companies like sap and oracle show that revenue from their cloud subscriptions is growing fast but is still much lower than traditional license revenue from on premises software for example sap said cloud revenue was of total revenue cloud plus software license and support in however that is changing in july sap told stock analysts that cloud s share of its new business contract value was nearly 2with that data in mind and our client experience we expect many companies to continue running the on premises versions of enterprise systems from oracle microsoft sap and other companies for the foreseeable future salesforce com s crm system has been a cloud based enterprise application from the start yet we expect other companies to switch to the cloud based versions of their enterprise systems over the next few years for two primary reasons ■ only cloud based versions of enterprise systems will offer business capabilities that are possible because of the unfettered on demand computing power that cloud data centers can offer cloud based enterprise software computing power can expand or shrink as needs change to provide the breakthrough digital customer experiences ■ major vendors of enterprise systems such as microsoft sap and oracle are themselves switching their focus to their cloud products and will sooner rather than later cease supporting their on premises systems while encouraging their clients to switch to the cloud by offering tempting benefits such as lower prices security enhancements and software updates with new features even if the enterprise system vendors stop supporting the on premises versions of their software other organizations will be there to provide support so we believe the first reason is the far more important one that cloud based enterprise systems will enable companies that periodically or more often than that need huge amounts of computing power to provide some digital product or digital experience the story of netflix s switch to the cloud more than years ago is a great case in point the instructive story of netflixcloud based applications can be truly transformative as netflix one of the early adopters of large scale cloud computing discovered more than a decade ago launched in netflix started out with a mail order business model selling and renting out dvds but in it started a new online streaming service offering customers about movies only of its catalogue to enable that it invested million to build out its data centers and pay for the license fees to stream movies to early adopter customers 3and that was for of its catalogue it did not take netflix s executives long to realize that they would not have enough money or data processing expertise to stream the remaining of its movies to its growing customer base accordingly in netflix turned to amazon web services cloud computing platforms this allowed netflix to offer customers a vastly improved experience as they could gain immediate access to their favorite movies rather than wait for snail mail to deliver a dvd and then be bothered with mailing it back the rest is history by netflix had million subscribers to its streaming service which generated more than of its billion in annual revenue as netflix grew adding new customers and keeping old ones the company has evolved into a media services provider moving into the content generation business by it had created billion worth of original content 4today netflix no longer owns a single data center yet by of all peak internet download traffic in north america came from netflix s streaming service 5the capabilities cloud based enterprise applications will offercompanies are starting to benefit from a range of new technologies in cloud based enterprise applications software capabilities that are creating a revolution in the digital customer experience three advancements are particularly important ■ advances in data analytics technologies are making it possible for companies to better detect and respond to customer trends forrester research has identified more than so called insights driven businesses including not only netflix but also amazon facebook google tesla aol and ge in they generated cumulative revenues of around billion and this figure is expected to grow to trillion by according to ted schadler a forrester research vice president and principal analyst these companies harness and apply data at every opportunity to differentiate their products and customer experiences and for those companies that are resisting the switch to cloud he has this warning that makes them faster and fleeter than you 7■ the rapid adoption of agile product development approaches means among other things that customer feedback can be fed directly into the product development cycle that allows companies to alter course and respond quickly to changing customer desires and needs as well as market conditions ■ the evolution of automation capabilities which allow companies to experiment cost effectively and test many product ideas at the same time to bring products to market faster than ever to seize these opportunities many companies will need computing power and real time response capabilities in the cloud based versions of their enterprise applications many companies are beginning to realize this for example earlier this decade klm the netherlands flagship airline found it could improve customer service through its interactions with customers through social media in when an icelandic volcano erupted that year klm was overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of posts from its million followers on social media channels passengers were providing the airline with important feedback but it was finding it difficult to respond in a timely way contact center agents struggled to deal with associated calls from customers to address the problem klm used salesforce s crm cloud service which included facebook and twitter private message functionality and digital genius artificial intelligence capability which provided intelligent chatbots for rapid customer service responses very quickly the airline saw an uptick in customer satisfaction with a significant reduction in call center handling times 9another way cloud based enterprise applications can transform the customer experience is by allowing companies to receive process and distribute huge numbers of digital files simultaneously as part of its routine customer interactions fiat chrysler automobiles must issue warranty and recall notices it is a complex undertaking and the automotive giant elected to use salesforce s cloud based software to institute automated recalls the technological solution led to an improved customer experience across the board as response times were better and service agents were freed up to spend more time on other customerfacing activities two key steps to migrating to cloud based enterprise applicationsagain moving to cloud based versions of an enterprise system will not be mandatory for many companies in the next few years but for those that want to shift to the cloud versions we suggest they follow a twostage process the strategic reviewcorporate leaders should audit their company s existing business requirements processes and enterprise applications then calculate the impact of migrating those applications to the cloud taking into account upfront costs the implications for business processes and the likely improvements in performance and security this lays the foundation for creating a business case for cloud migration aligned with the company s overall business strategy this should includeinformation about the competitive landscape and prevalent market trends for enterprise applications in particular and technology in general as part of this process they should look for opportunities to simplify the company s it infrastructure the implementation plan once the strategic review has been conducted a clear implementation plan is essential after addressing critical data issues such as security and privacy the amount and type of data to be migrated and data cleansing requirements leaders should create a series of work streams to ensure a seamless migration from on premise to cloud based enterprise systems companies must address the context of the initiative covering the quality of the user experience the alignment of business processes with the firm s goals and objectives and change management challenges including the creation of an internal communications strategy as roles and jobs will be transformed along with technology all work streams should focus on the core components of a successful migration from on premises to cloud based enterprise applications for instance there should be one process for data migration that covers not only all the different types of data from basic user login details to sophisticated transaction data that will be loaded onto cloud based enterprise applications but also the digital tools required to extract the data from the legacy on premises systems another work stream should cover the integration of all the cloud based enterprise applications for example how crm sales and customer service applications will be integrated with hr supply chain management financials data warehouse and external data feeds two separate work streams should cover mobile devices and social media it will be important that the new cloud based enterprise applications can be accessed on mobile devices which is how customers and employees increasingly expect to use them social media must be leveraged for generating sales leads and capturing customer feedback on products and services other work streams should cover key performance indicators and how the information should be presented on dashboards dedicated portals for customers and employees and global requirements and the extent to which the selected cloud based system can take a follow the sun approach by catering to local needs around the world with so many work streams migrating on premises enterprise applications to their cloud versions can be immensely complex as a result we recommend two other work streams that address some very practical implementation issues user adoption and testing the user adoption work stream should draw up the detailed programs for training those employees who will be key users of the cloud based enterprise applications the testing work stream should devise stress tests for the whole enterprise system and build in time for fixes and retesting to confirm quality if the new cloud based enterprise system passes tough stress tests it will be ready to be rolled out across the company yet another work stream should take charge of drawing up a series of go live plans based on business needs ideally the plans should be rolled out in phases possibly starting with a pilot run in such a complex environment problems will arise and a phased roll out will give corporate leaders working with their cloud provider partners the chance to address and overcome them migration stories how two companies moved to cloud based enterprise applicationsconsider the case of a japan based global cash solutions company that had made multiple acquisitions over several years and developed numerous lines of business in more than countries in it was faced with a chaotic set of legacy enterprise systems that were degrading operational efficiency and preventing it from growing effectively to solve the problem the company decided to launch a digital transformation with the aim of creating a fully digitized and integratedoperation using oracle s cloud based applications it then carried out a phased in three step approach to migrating from on premises applications to oracle hybrid cloud applications this strategy reduced operational and other risks in addition it enabled the company to learn from any difficulties that arose while demonstrating both real and potential returns on investment the first step set up to reap early business benefits through quick wins while ensuring business continuity was implementing customerfacing customer experience components service customer relationship management marketing and configure price quote cpq these were chosen for their relative ease of implementation and because if the implementation went sideways it would have a relatively trivial impact on the overall business the second major step the financial services firm took was migrating core business functions such as manufacturing finance and the supply chain operation this step involved integrating different types of applications software as a service infrastructure as a service and on premises applications the company selected a pilot site for implementing the standard global oracle cloud solution which mitigated the risk to its global business the third step implementing additional components such as financial planning and budgeting compliance and executive reporting provided data integrity and a single source of the truth for improved corporate governance transparency and traceability within the company s consolidated reporting platform the strategic three step approach proved a success yielding significant reductions in the legacy it costs as well as in the customer s purchase and sales order cycle times the financial services company is now implementing multiple planned rollouts of its digital transformation across countries similarly a british engineering firm employing people had amassed many disjointed hr systems with ineffective controls and reporting as a result the hr team had little visibility into staffing levels and this was leading to poor operational efficiency and an underwhelming customer experience to tackle the problem the firm integrated its hr operations with the business suite offered by successfactors which provides cloud based human capital management software solutions as a first step it set up a steering committee to provide strong governance and oversight of the implementation program then the new cloud based hr system was deployed in a series of modules including an employee portal training recruitment management recruitment marketing and on boarding and then trained key users who in turn were tasked with training their fellow workers the results have been substantial the engineering firm now has what it calls one version of the truth when it comes to hr management and there have been several other benefits a seamless flow of data for the recruitment process the capacity to adopt best practices reduced costs from a cloud applications subscription model and improved employee engagement it s decision time for companies that must shift to cloud based enterprise systemsenterprise systems operating on premises or delivered from the cloud are a foundation for digital transformation for companies that soon will need the cloud capabilities of an enterprise system the time has come to decide when and how to move to the cloud those that already determined they needed the immense on demand computing power of cloud based enterprise systems are reaping the benefits 1zdnet article jan accessed july surge 2comment from sap cfo luka mucic in transcript from sap s q2 earnings call on

69,customer support has become a key differentiator in almost every industry it s especially important for companies that provide costly complex and critical equipment and other products from industrial manufacturers of power equipment heavy vehicles hvac systems and medical devices to makers of home computers appliances and cars competition in these sectors has intensified not simply on the basis of who has the better product but which company can provide the best experience after customer s purchase indeed as many products and services have become commoditized customer support can be the only factor that sets a company apart s in a recent salesforce com survey of customer service leaders in nearly manufacturing companies said the customer experience they provided was a key differentiator 1investing in ongoing customer support is no longer an option in large part because it s easier than ever for dissatisfied customers to find another source seven out of consumers and of business buyers said technology makes it easy to find alternatives for their purchases if they are unhappy with customer service according to the salesforce com report what s more of business buyers said they would likely switch to another brand if their experience with a manufacturer was inconsistent across that manufacturer s departments however providing highly effective customer support is difficult to do and can raise a manufacturer s costs significantly as a result both b2b and b2c manufacturers have been increasing their investment in post sales customer support those companies who rated their service performance as excellent in the salesforce com survey were times more likely to have increased their service budgets over the previous two years than the underperformers and they were times more likely to plan to increase their budget over the following two years adding the contact centers customer service staff field repair forces and other resources required to provide high quality service is not always cost effective the mounting costs of long term customer support is quickly becoming economically untenable for many companies the automotive industry is a prime example of an industry of the mounting costs of customer service in this case the cost of managing product recalls in and more than million vehicles were recalled annually in the u s more than twice the recall rate two decades earlier likely a result of the increase in electronic parts and software in vehicles as a result u s based automakers and their suppliers paid billion in claims in for defective products according to alixpartners 2there is a way forward though that can make it possible for companies to provide significantly better customer support at dramatically lower costs they can take advantage of rapidly advancing intelligent automation systems a combination of sensors cognitive capabilities and robotics to transform customer support but doing so requires vision and leadership customer service and technology leaders along with their executive committees and business unit leaders must relinquish their traditional notions of customer support and reimagine those processes for the digital age those that seize the opportunity to incorporate intelligent automation into their customer support operations can not only cut their support costs they can provide proactive and even predictive customer service boost loyalty and revenues and gather intelligence to improve future product designs the big picturesome companies have begun to invest in the automation technologies that could reduce the cost and improve the nature of post sale customer service but the majority have only scratched the surface of the transformation these tools could enable many have begun with the most obvious application of cognitive capabilities complementing or replacing contact center labor in there were no web chat offerings smart phone apps or social media interactions for customer service email was rarely used for customer issues by digital interactions such as email web chat social media texts and instant messaging accounted for percent of customer interactions 3just of customer service and support operations have integrated their virtual customer assistant or chatbot technology across their engagement channels a proportion set to rise to by while implementing software that sounds like a human customer support agent is an interesting application it doesn t go far enough to differentiate a company s customer support function in fact it may not even be the highest value use case for automation companies may see greater returns but keeping their human customer service force in place and applying their automation investments in other areas that offer more significant improvements in customer care and costs such as deploying automated systems that can make human agents more effective as siemens ge tetra pak hp otis elevator cargill medivators and other companies are finding those that use intelligent automation technology in customer support are fundamentally rethinking what customer support could become in an era of powerful automation technologies they realize that automation technologies provide them and their customers with customer support capabilities that weren t technically or economically possible in the past how intelligent automation transforms customer supportthe new customer support capabilities that intelligent automation technologies make possible can be organized into six categories preventing product breakdowns from happening in the first place predictive maintenance is one of the killer applications of intelligent automation companies can monitor products for signs of potential failure and address the problem before it happens spending on predictive maintenance applications enabled by internet of things iot technologies is on the rise iot analytics predicts such spending will grow annually from billion in to billion by salesforce com found of manufacturers were using iot in customer service and more than of them were already using the technology to diagnose products how customers are using them and identify product and component failures 6otis elevator which has been remotely monitoring its products for more than years launched an iot enabled service called otis one this may smart sensors gather information from more than elevators and escalators in service sending that data to the cloud for analysis the system alerts building owners and the firm s service technicians of elevators and escalators that are likely to break down through a two way video connection the new service also notifies passengers in malfunctioning elevators that help is on the way 8schneider electric se is outfitting its oil pumps with iot to predict mechanical problems in remote locations for its oil field drilling customers schneider electric gathers that information in the cloud where machine learning applications detect patterns in rod pump mechanisms that point to impending failures the technology can also change the way a pump operates to avoid shutdowns and notify the customer that a repair must be done fixing problems remotely in some cases companies can take intelligent maintenance a step further automatically fixing products remotely or after a customer notifies them of a problem software vendors have been able to provide remote fixes for years and the mobile app industry has since followed suit such capabilities are now spreading to other industries the newest models from car manufacturers like cadillac and ford can receive over the air updates to the software they have on board these updates could save automakers billions of dollars a year according to one industry analyst in electric car maker tesla enabled its car owners to download software to fix problematic keyless entry systems and add new features such as automatic lane changing and windshield wipers that adjust their speed based on the amount of rain 12minneapolis based medical device maker medivators recently implemented a new field service system from ge and software company ptc to enable remote diagnostics and service more than three quarter of the company s service calls are now resolved from afar elevating contact center and field repair capabilities intelligent automation can complement the capabilities of human contact center agents and field repair personnel with automated advisers that walk them through the best solutions to customers problems some companies have reduced the costs of responding to customer inquiries by as much as and boosted customer satisfaction by implementing virtual customer assistants according to gartner 14siemens uses intelligent automation to repair its recently unveiled ehighway an electric road freight transport system that reduces pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions on heavily used truck routes technicians servicing the trucks can provide service with their hands free of manuals using microsoft s hololens to view a service checklist and repair diagrams and remotely consult with experts at headquarters 15likewise tetra pak a manufacturer of food processing and packaging machines and systems also delivers work instructions via mobile app and augmented reality its service technicians carry smartphones loaded with apps to tap into service manuals checklists problemsolving methodologies and a global issue database technicians or machine operators who need help with a machine can don augmented reality goggles that let remote tetra pak specialists view problems live and from the field and offer step by step advice to repair equipment enabling customers to solve problems using remote diagnosis ai and other technologies companies can provide advice and tools to customers so they can solve product problems themselves hp has been using automated technologies to help customers fix their hp computers and printers in hp handled more than million requests for technical support it developed a virtual intelligent agent that engages customers in a conversation and helps them diagnose and solve problems identifying the most pertinent information from hp s pages of product information if hp s virtual agent can t fix the issue the customer is transferred to a customer support agent who has all the information that the virtual agent has collected on the issue including remote diagnostic results the customer s system state and its serial number eliminating recurring product issues intelligent automation can also help companies pinpoint continual problems with current products in the field and fix product design flaws in future updates or product generations this is a newer application of iot and ai but one likely to provide significant value in the near future there aren t a lot of line engineers adopting iot to make products better says bryan kester director of iot for product design software and engineering company autodesk but he expects that to change quickly once product designers and engineers see the benefit of product performance data and analytics in their work we re finally at a point where design engineers seem to have valid reasons for experimenting with iot he says 18sensor analytics solution provider konux s cloud based ai system continuously learns from the sensor alerts it receives to continually improve the overall performance of the system and give recommendations for extending asset life cycles 19companies could even take this to the point of products that make themselves better you can start to figure out those product design problems quickly and understand the sources of error and failure on a fleet of manufacturing assets says chris larkin ge vice president of products analytics and machine learning we believe the intelligent asset of the future is self healing and self adjusting helping customers use products more effectively intelligent automation can be applied not just to fix product problems but also help customers get greater value from those products sensors can monitor how customers are using a product and provide automated advice about how to improve what they re doing with it agribusiness giant cargill has partnered with consumer physics to develop a spectrometer to help dairy farmers analyze the forage their cows eat by making the device small enough to fit in a farmer s pocket and connecting it to a smartphone application and the cloud this iotenabled system analyzes the cows diet at the site enabling farmers to do make better nutritional choices for their cows right there and then 21in fitness wearable maker fitbit collaborated with northwestern medicine and the university of california san francisco to study the impact of physical activity of patients who underwent spinal surgery in this case the product being monitored is the patient s back the researchers can track patients physical activity four weeks before surgery and six months afterwards not simply to predict which ones are at risk of being readmitted to the hospital but also to suggest ongoing physical regiments to reduce that possibility 22employing intelligent automation in your cx transformationto reap these significant and wide ranging benefits companies must move beyond the short sighted view that the sole value of ai and other automation technologies is in replacing customer support personnel the technologies may indeed reduce the human workload over time but that s not the right starting point for transforming post sales customer support instead companies should start by first determining how they might use intelligent automation within the product they manufacture while they re in customer s possession or to reduce the need for customer support altogether they should also think about how to combine and leverage product usage maintenance and customer inquiry information with other data and to improve the customer experience over the product lifecycle they should also explore integrating data from their crm systems to get a deeper understanding of the types of support and product problems that are occurring the supply chain system to identify where flawed products are in the system and product lifecycle management systems to correct design flaws that are showing up in the field the following actions can help companies use intelligent automation to lower costs and improve the quality of post sales customer support ■ explore which service improvements would have the most value for customers and which they might actually pay for ■ determine which processes to automate to deliver that value including the data collection and analysis required to understand changing customer behavior design thinking can be used to simulate test and refine new customer service options ■ select the appropriate intelligent automation technologies for those high value use cases ■ making the financial case for the intelligent automation investment calculating the initial and ongoing automation costs against the customer revenue loyalty and other improvements ■ begin with one pilot project and gather intelligence on what works and what doesn t to enable broader applications ■ invest in it systems that can support the experimental design and testing approach required for iterative transformation a combination of agile devops and provisioning automation ■ study emerging trends in how customers are reacting to automation technologies such as voice activated assistants add the most valuable ones to the intelligent customer support platform a cost effective means to provide long term customer careas the commoditization of products and services across b2b and b2c industries increases customer experience has become the key differentiator for manufacturers not just leading up to a sale but in the area of long term customer support intelligent automation offers a way forward for leading companies to elevate that experience in six significant ways while controlling the costs required to do so 1revolutionizing customer service in manufacturing salesforce com

70,accustomed to seamless interactions and personalized consumer experiences on their smartphones customers now are looking for the same in their business experiences to meet this rising expectation companies are redesigning the user experience ux by implementing smart technologies and design thinking focused on the end user to mimic human interactions here are just four examples smart user interfaces that allow customers to personalize their experience according to their preferences giving them control of the interactions chatbots that can understand voice or text and reply in a human manner voice agents that sound human responding and taking actions in contextually appropriate ways to customer queries artificial intelligence ai technology such as email assistants that can schedule meetings with other ai based assistants without requiring humans to go back and forth to align each other s schedules these advanced design solutions are good for business a study by the design management institute found the stock prices of design led companies outperformed the s p index by over the previous years and a recent forrester study found half of design led businesses believe advanced design practices boost customer satisfaction and loyalty 2many companies are adopting agile business practices automation and ai however those wishing to distinguish themselves need to deliver superior personalized multichannel customer experiences cx to do that companies must master a blend of design processes with cuttingedge technological skills getting it wrong a bad mix of the outdated with the avant gardedesigning experiences for customers begins by understanding their behaviors and preferences and that means taking advantage of advanced analytics tools without fact based insights into what customers want companies will miss the mark in trying to create a superior cx on the one hand some cx designers are trapped in the past their designs limited by what was possible or years ago not what can be done today with new technologies such as virtual reality augmented reality or chatbots with natural language processing capabilities as a result these designers produce cxs that are like an early automobile equipped with rough riding wooden wagon wheels on the flip side there are designers so eager to deploy the latest technologies that they fail to consider whether they have business value these designers want ai augmented reality or chatbots in all their designs but fail to consider the humans who will use them and the businesses that must pay for them for example they might spend too much money and take too much time to deploy a chatbot to answer questions that could have been resolved through a basic frequently asked questions faq web page at both extremes these cx designers are not practicing human centered design thinking designers should begin with data at their fingertips and combine it with old school user research and testing to develop a deeper understanding of customer needs and desires then they should pick appropriate technological solutions from the full toolbox of possibilities what works designing interactive cx based on deep customer knowledgecx designers should never use technology for its own sake instead they should only deploy technology to help customers accomplish tasks more efficiently effectively and effortlessly the best cx starts with a deep understanding of how a company s customers behave what they perceive and how they like to interact with the company and each other cx design should seek to improve the customer s journey making it simpler faster more efficient and more pleasurable by enabling continuous innovation offering better or entirely new journeys for their customers chatbots ai and other advanced technologies may play important roles but only in the service of improving the cx or reimagining the way companies sell to or serve their market and customers some of the most successful design led companies have found ways to use technologies to improve and reconceive their cx for instance ■ instead of forcing users to hunt for information they need google assistant proactively provides contextual notifications about flight status traffic updates product shipments and more without being asked ■ netflix uses a complex algorithm to evaluate tv and movie content according to thousands of qualifiers including elements of mood aesthetic and pace the algorithm integrates with machine learning and ai to recommend programs that customers might not have found on their own customers clearly trust and appreciate these recommendations netflix says of the content its viewers watch comes from these automated recommendations they have been a big factor in the company s nearly tenfold revenue growth between and from billion to billion 3designers must be able to empathize with the problems customers face for example most companies have far to go in designing their cx to be accessible and inclusive for people with special needs also as the senior population grows cx designers will need to tailor the ux to their needs for example letting them adjust font sizes or putting titles on all videos for customers with hearing loss such inclusive cx design sends a welcoming compassionate message to all customers and build long term trust and loyalty finally for cx design innovations to be sustainable they must add value to the business delighting the customer by orchestrating a smooth intuitive journey must go hand in hand with improving revenue market leadership depends upon finding the right balance between cx investment and profitability how design led thinking spurs innovationto design great customer experiences designers must first gather insights on customer needs to determine which problems their designs should solve having gathered these insights designers should work together to generate ideas develop prototypes and iteratively refine their best concepts design led thinking incorporates technology but it starts with a focus on customers for example when ford motor s lincoln division set about redesigning its continental luxury car for the brazilian and indian markets it began by considering the needs of luxury car users in those countries because both brazil and india have a significant air pollution problems lincoln made sure the car had good air seals and because traffic in large brazilian and indian cities is typically snarled business meetings often are held in cars accordingly lincoln equipped its cars for those markets with tray tables and other conveniences to make it easier to hold meetings inside the automobiles 4such companies complemented their data driven designs with rapid prototyping using agile development methods designers conducted tests collected customer feedback refined their ideas and launched value added products and services into the marketplace for example when insurance and financial services company massmutual realized its life insurance products were not appealing to consumers under it worked with a global design partner to develop an educational multichannel experience that would serve as a sort of master s program for adulthood to implement the program massmutual embraced new digital tools and new business processes committed to the principles of good cx massmutual designed the program to be flexible so that it can evolve as the company gleans new insights from participants 5service design developing a better understanding of the customer journeyas digital ecosystems grow more complex customer journeys and the systems needed to facilitate those journeys also become more complicated a service design approach can help companies visualize investigate and understand customer touchpoints and lifecycles even as they become more self aware comprehending the people processes systems and organizational cultures that enable these experiences by examining the entire customer lifecycle as well as their own capabilities companies may discover places where and how their brands could do a better job meeting their customers expectations and discovering other business areas ripe for innovation rethinking the customer journey matching new interactive technologies to cxcompanies have a golden opportunity to deliver interactive experiences through emerging channels however trying to match new technologies with traditional user journeys is unlikely to succeed instead companies should attempt to imagine creative use cases that disrupt existing journeys in designing these innovative processes and pathways that take full advantage of new technologies companies should keep three guardrails in mind roi define key metrics at the beginning of the design process then measure performance at milestones along the way to make sure projects deliver their intended benefits agile engineering respond to feedback with an iterative improvement loop that fuels faster development and leads to continuous improvement in cx lean user experience as work progresses iteratively look for ways to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization designing results what to expect from successful cx ux transformationsby following these companies can achieve five types of cx transformations moving from taking orders to making recommendations any company can respond to demand and give customers the products they request design led companies advance to the next level by suggesting products and services that customers are likely to enjoy and appreciate companies that excel in this field like netflix and amazon collect and analyze large data sets to develop a deep understanding of the customers latent wants and needs ultimately the goal is to know one s customers so well that a company can reliably anticipate what sorts of products or services will delight them changing from solving problems to preventing them any company can react to problems that customers report better ones solve problems before they occur good cx designers constantly evaluate customer journeys to identify potential problems before they become major headaches companies can then nip them in the bud to keep customers happy and loyal going from clueless to clued in clueless companies do not have a finger on the customer pulse consequently they are caught by surprise when customer dissatisfaction surfaces clued in companies continuously monitor the effectiveness of their cx they notice pain points early on and have full situational awareness of any problems customers may be having with a product or service as a result they can correct problems quickly and give customers a better experience with their products or services shifting from lengthy response times to instant help years ago many industries moved at a slower pace in those days customers might be willingly to wait several days or longer for solutions to their problems now customers expect problems to be resolved in hours or even minutes fortunately technological advances can help companies keep pace for example some financial advisory firms have begun using ai and neural networks to expedite answers to customer inquiries one firm with which tcs has worked uses an automated system that manages analyzes and responds to complex client emails this system understands each email s content interprets the customer s intent and emotion then accurately responds with a set of suitable recommendations transitioning from simple to complex uses of automation plenty of companies use automated services to help customers with simple problems this sort of automation might administer a phone tree or remind customers of their account balances that s child s play compared to the real prize of using ai and machine learning to build automated services that solve problems in ways that dramatically improve cx design led cx three companies improving customer journeys and reaping rewardsacross industries and geographies companies have begun using design thinking to improve cx each of these examples show how design led initiatives to improve cx can help enterprises solve major problems and achieve significant roi changing the weather for customers in scotlandin scotland a large water utility faced supply interruptions low pressure contamination threats and customer fury each winter when low temperatures caused aging pipes to freeze and burst the utility s call centers were overwhelmed with complaints its reputation suffered a serious blow and regulators penalized the company with heavy fines the utility could not change the weather but it could change the way it handled customer complaints it adopted flexible omnichannel methods of taking customer complaints via email and through its website as well as over the phone this approach simultaneously lowered costs and reduced pressure on the call centers the new system the company implemented had the technological capability to automate service orders and dispatch repair crews it also gave the utility the ability to update customers via text message on the progress of repairs while using predictive analytics and personalization to customize each customer s experience by using agile engineering methods and advanced technologies such as automation the utility designed a lean frictionless cx as a result it saved £12 million and saw customer complaints drop in a single year streamlining design for profiteaton corp plc the ireland based leader in power management and equipment sales was making customers struggle through a complex purchase process even worse the company incurred steep operating costs as it juggled more than online storefronts and tried to cope with siloed product categories spread across the enterprise determined to resolve these issues eaton embarked on a design led process to improve the way customers accessed and experienced its products services promotions and offers there were three major components to the redesign a global ecommerce strategy with streamlined processes built on a modern technological foundation a unified online storefront and product catalog and localized solution support for nine languages six currencies and various local units of measurement these and numerous other changes have helped the company grow strongly in recent years annual revenue has risen nearly since from billion to billion customers reported greater satisfaction with the purchase process eaton managed to create new cross selling opportunities while simultaneously reducing its operating costs enhancing engagement through integration and customizationthe customers of u s health insurance company humana had to deal with more than separate websites the billion company revenue8 wanted to create an integrated unified digital brand that would offer its users personalized consistent cx across all channels using a design led approach the company updated more than webpages to offer a better ux its new web presence featured rich media and responsive user engagement features by gathering more than components under a single digital platform humana gave customers a consistent unified experience with the company the new digital platform made it easier for humana to engage with its customers through social channels it also gave humana the ability to customize and contextualize its communications strategy making sure that customers receive the right promotions at the right time these improvements to its digital cx helped humana increase its customer base the best time to build better digital cx now companies across multiple sectors around the world have discovered the value of using design led thinking to give customers smoother easier and more interactive experiences advanced technologies like ai natural language processing smart chatbots and automation have advanced to the point where they can play a major role in meeting customer demands and wishes the caveat here is that these tools are only effective if they are deployed systematically and purposefully through a design led process technology for its own sake can be an expensive distraction technology used in the service of meeting and exceeding customer expectations can be a game changer of course technology also has an important role to play in discovering these customer insights through the collection analysis and reporting on big data sets using these insights companies can then deploy agile lean and iterative processes to find which technological solutions will have the biggest impact on cx and offer the greatest competitive advantage in customer attraction and retention 1dmi the value of design accessed july at christine murray design led firms win the

71,blockchain technology which came to prominence with the success of the cryptocurrency bitcoin has the potential to transform the way companies interact with their customers blockchain is a platform for decentralized computing that enables anyone to exchange value with another party without relying on a central authority to transact securely this means individuals or organizations can conduct their activities without an intermediary today senior executives in nearly every economic sector are looking to harness blockchain s power to create new value for customers for example through the food trust blockchain group walmart is collaborating with major players in the food consumer goods and retail industry including dole foods kroger tyson foods and unilever to create a system designed to be the equivalent of fedex tracking for food says frank yiannas walmart vice president for food safety why do this because now it can take too long to trace contaminated food in the supply chain for instance between hours and six days to trace a shipment of mango slices from a mexican orchard to a walmart store in arkansas using paper and existing it systems that rely on barcode scanners in a demo the blockchain system did it in seconds rather than having to wait days to address an outbreak of a food borne illness or some other quality control issue that affects customers walmart could respond almost instantly avoiding reputational damage and more importantly guarding the public s health as this example illustrates blockchain can help companies become better at what they already do by reducing their costs thereby delivering savings that can be passed on to the customer in the form of bettervalue products and services and by reducing the sources of friction that can degrade the customer relationship we think of this as a curve blockchain opportunity one that makes a marketplace of buyers sellers and the parties in between them more efficient but blockchain s impact is likely to be far greater at its most advanced the technology can help companies transform the life experiences of their customers they can do this by collaborating in decentralized networks that include other companies individuals governments and non governmental organizations ngos to create more personalized life experiences everything from birthday parties green vacations new homes and new jobs to integrated healthcare and start to finish journeys involving planes trains and automobiles we think of this as a curve opportunity that creates life experience ecosystems the companies on this curve will use blockchain to interact with their customers in new ways to compete and succeed in the emerging blockchain landscape companies need to ride both curves see figure below in general as described by ian morrison former president of the institute for the future innovation along curve represents improvements to the status quo to optimize processes and make an organization more competitive curve represents innovation around new models at some point a curve model will emerge to become mainstream itself beginning the optimization path as the next curve in a continuous back and forth between innovation and maturity investing in blockchain along both curves helps prepare organizations for the crossover when curve innovation surpasses curve becoming the new norm blockchain now curve remove friction and frustration from the customer experienceblockchain technology represents a valuable opportunity for creating efficiencies in existing ecosystems because it cuts out the need for an expensive and inefficient layer of intermediaries the technology employs three key concepts to achieve this ■ adigital ledger links authenticated records of transactions known as blocks in a way that is transparent trustworthy and verifiable encrypted and decentralized this means that participants in the blockchain all see the same changes to the shared record of events at the same time no third party entity needs to update the ledger or validate it the changes are secured through encryption and every block that updates the blockchain is authenticated before it is added to the shared record that embeds security in the chain ■ smart contractsallow people to make transactions based on transparent known and unchangeable rules as a result there is no need for middlemen to get between a company and its customers the cost savings from eliminating non value adding parties can be passed on to consumers through lower prices or better products and services ■ adigital identity for customers known as the self sovereign digital identity allows customers to keep a single digital identity for all their accounts eliminating the need for burdensome logins and passwords it also reduces the risk of security breaches by eliminating the need for central servers that store personally identifiable information among the sectors that are already capitalizing or looking to capitalize on blockchain to enhance the customer experience are travel and tourism health care and the automobile industry travel blockchain more efficient traveler security faster bookingsin the travel industry companies are experimenting with blockchain to improve the experience of tourists everything from making security more efficient to faster bookings shocard for instance is a startup that has developed a service for airlines that expedites the check in process at airports and cuts the time customers spend in long queues passengers upload all their travel documents which are registered on a blockchain they are then given a single travel token that airlines can use to verify their identity quickly and securely 4another startup winding tree offers a decentralized travel distribution network the swiss company is working with six airlines and a hotel chain to create a shared booking platform with real time information on holiday tour packages the initiative is designed to circumvent the big distributors of travel services which can charge package holiday providers commissions of up to thereby reducing the customer s costs 5health care blockchain new platform for electronic medical recordsin the health care industry blockchain technology has enormous potential to make sharing medical records more efficient secure and privacy compliant a study found of health care organizations expect to have a blockchain based system in place by the end of the year with expecting to invest in implementations by 6today a patient s medical history rarely resides in a single place or file typically electronic health records are held separately by hospitals medical labs clinicians and other healthcare institutions and professionals the result patients and their doctors seldom have quick and easy access to a complete medical history which can be critical to their care how can blockchain help every health record could be tagged with the patient s unique digital identity encrypted sent to cloud storage and registered in the blockchain to access these records patients would use a private key and grant access to doctors and others who need to refer to their complete medical record medrec based at the mit media lab is developing such a blockchain system 7insurers and health care providers also are experimenting with the technology nashville based change healthcare a network with doctors dentists and pharmacies has launched a blockchain to process insurance claims and a group including humana inc optum and quest diagnostics is working on a blockchain directory of health care providers to make listings more accurate and accessible 9blockchain s future curve when companies partner with customers on end to end experienceswhile blockchain technology can be used to help companies make their current business better its greatest potential lies in helping companies innovate and make their business different in his comments on the blockchain revolution apple co founder steve wozniak says we re at one of those times in technological economic and social history where the sky is the limit in the blockchain enabled world consumers can become active producers of the goods and services they use socalled prosumers as such they can partner with companies and other organizations in decentralized networks that transact and create value instead of offering customers just one or two parts of an overall desired life experience companies could collaborate with them on shared platforms enabled by blockchain technology for example the birthday party business is a huge recurring revenue generator around the world today customers must cobble together the various products and services that go into creating a memorable celebration the venue the invitations the food and drink the entertainment the party decorations the transport to and from the venue and so on but in a blockchain enabled world it is possible to imagine that the different providers of the products and services for a birthday party could come together and with the customer design a bundled one stop service that takes the stress out of the day leaving the pleasure new partners indigenous peoples and the tourists who visit themalready one can find pioneering experimentation with blockchain in the travel and tourism industry idgo is a collaborative partnership working to ensure that the world s million indigenous peoples can reap the rewardsof visitors to their communities and lands as opposed to the current situation where they rarely enjoy the benefits of tourist revenue idgo s planned blockchain enabled services include 11■ a digital identity for indigenous people and for tourists who visit them and their lands tourists would pay a fee to receive a special passport with proceeds going to the local community to be reinvested in environmental protection education and indigenous cultural activities ■ a community token and associated smart wallet one of the key components of blockchain technology alongside the ledger the smart contract and the digital identity is the special token or coin known as a purpose driven currency this provides a means of exchange between participants in the life experience ecosystem with idgo the indigenous people can give tourists community tokens that can be used to pay for goods and services for instance on orchid island in taiwan the tao people were largely unknown to the outside world before the 1960s ever since they have seen a surge of tourists some tourists now visit the island every year generating income for travel companies but generating tons of trash per month for the local people to clean up facing threats to their culture and environment the tao people hope the new blockchain enabled partnership will help them accommodate the tourists and the revenue they bring while restoring their island to its former pristine state and if successful idgo plans to extend the partnership in australia new zealand canada and the united states a billion travel and hospitality market involving indigenous people and million tourists 12in our view experiments like these are just the beginning many other industries can transform the way they operate and enhance the customer experience with blockchain technology a wellness ecosystem for health careblockchain could help the healthcare industry transform its mission from treating sickness to improving health the foundation for other life experiences in the united states of healthcare expenditures go toward treating chronic problems cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes given that all the industry s economic incentives reward procedural remedies surgery and drugs this is not surprising but there is another way a blockchain enabled wellness ecosystem that could improve the health care system experience by facilitating collaboration and the efficient delivery of all healthcare services various stakeholders collaborating through a blockchain enabled network could provide people with incentives to lead healthier lives employers could give their employees reward tokens for exercising restaurants could provide customers with benefits for choosing healthy menu options and insurers could compensate participating restaurants since they benefit from individuals leading healthy lives what s more individual patients as prosumers could offer ideas for enhanced experiences based on their input and their participation levels in the varied offerings over time such behavioral remedies could lead to a healthier population and reduce health care costs a journey ecosystem for the auto industrythe blockchain can transform the commuting experience which would have major implications for the automotive industry around the world cities are planning to protect the environment and improve their citizens lives by banning cars hamburg germany for example plans to allow only pedestrians and bikers to enter certain areas to counter this existential threat automobile manufacturers could encourage car sharing companies to join blockchain enabled networks that promote intermodal transport one can imagine a journey ecosystem consisting of car sharing companies bike sharing firms office providers restaurants government agencies shopping malls and housing communities together the transport providers could create a single billing system so customers could use a bike car or train and pay for all of them at one convenient location at the same time employers government agencies and housing communities could use reward tokens to promote good transport habits reducing congestion and pollution and creating more engaged customers action plan what companies need to do nowwhen deciding how to approach blockchain it might seem tempting to focus first on optimizing the efficiencies of the existing business but we recommend that companies conduct parallel programs that focus on both efficiency and life experience opportunities if companies delay experiments with life experience ecosystems they risk disruption by networks of blockchain connected competitors working collaboratively to create offerings that address a person s life holistically rather than a focusing on a narrowly defined customer experience such life experiences will bring new levels of convenience and facilitate more meaningful ways for customers to interact with a company s offerings this is an opportunity to pursue now not later once senior executives have decided to launch a parallel program efficiency and life experience they should create two teams staffed with full time dedicated business and technical specialists the team focused on efficiency should look for innovative ways that blockchain can help the current business become more customer focused for instance by removing some of the day to day friction that frustrates them it should look to partner with suppliers and other business collaborators the other team should focus on life experience ecosystems looking for inventive ways blockchain can be used to create new businesses that engage with customers and competitors in novel ways this team should include experts skilled in disciplines such as behavioral psychology game theory and self governing organizations they need to be able to think beyond traditional industry relationships and include customers as contributors of business value although the teams should be separate and focused on different opportunities they should nevertheless follow the same five step innovation process strategic ideation employ the efficiency team to analyze the company s current ecosystems while the experience team analyzes all potentially relevant ecosystems the teams should then map all the blockchain enabled innovation opportunities for the different ecosystems portfolio development create a portfolio of blockchain enabled opportunities the efficiency team identifying the innovations that will sustain existing products and services and the experience team identifying disruptive innovations that could create new products and services to meet the growing customer demand for differentiating experiences business case development the teams draw up business cases for each of the opportunities prototyping and testing the teams provide demonstrable proof of the value of these opportunities creating and testing prototype products and services in an agile lean development approach greenlight the best companies identify and implement the opportunities that are shown to have the greatest benefits for the company and its ecosystem partners an important final point to consider is this companies should take great care to adopt an open collaborative approach to blockchain ideation and implementation it is natural to think that the product of all this experimentation should be protected as valuable intellectual property but companies that look to build walls around their inventions as they have traditionally done may struggle to succeed in the highly interdependent interconnected blockchain era the people at the forefront of blockchain innovation rekindling the spirit of the early days of the world wide web are committed to working in open collaborative ways to attract this talent companies need to embark on open collective problem solving initiatives companies that erect walls around their innovation will be hard pressed to match the speed of innovation possible with open source development with its transparent code base that can be tested modified and improved by people intrinsically motivated to do so no time to loseblockchain is a new technology it is not surprising that many senior executives are still exploring the full implications of what it means for them and their companies but they cannot afford to take too long to get up to speed blockchain innovation is occurring so swiftly that companies may be disrupted if they do not act soon right now the chances arethat competitors as well as new market entrants are actively exploring potential blockchain based innovations accordingly senior executives should make pursuing a two pronged program of blockchain experimentation seeking opportunities on both curve and curve to help their company compete more effectively by generating greater efficiencies and collaborate more productively by joining innovative networks focused on creating value if done right they can hope to create an enduring relationship with newly engaged customers and position the company for a sustainable future in an age of disruption the authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of subhajit das to this article 1bigchaindb blockchain

72,large companies worldwide are moving their it applications and infrastructure to the cloud recognizing that creating innovative products and services and developing key strategic differentiators depends on the enormous computational resources that can be leveraged only through third party cloud vendors this trend represents a shift in thinking about how and why companies deploy cloud computing previously migrating to the cloud was considered a tactical play a way to reduce it costs and transform sunken capital expenditures into pay as you go operating expenses today moving apps and other it systems to the cloud is viewed increasingly as a business growth imperative essential to revenue generation competitive differentiation and meeting the requirements of agility flexibility scalability availability there are many critical functions that cannot be implemented without the huge round the clock computational resources of major public cloud vendors such as aws microsoft or google and the cloud has become essential to helping companies offer a superior digital customer experience given that moving a business s it to the cloud is a massive and complex effort many companies struggle with where to begin they must decide the order in which applications should be migrated they must also determine whether proprietary information and sensitive data especially customer data should reside in a public private or hybrid cloud a question that has become increasingly fraught given the new and strict consumer privacy laws recently enacted in europe and other countries why tactical lift and shift cloud migration is inadequatein the past cios intended to take an it driven approach to cloud migration the initial focus was on cost and the movement started with a lift and shift approach of moving tasks from on premises systems to the cloud this tactical approach is not optimal because it is based on creating it efficiencies rather than building strategic digital capabilities that can provide competitive advantages companies that lift and shift are addressing their existing challenges but they are not considering the vast possibilities cloud systems offer like application modernization digital transformation and data monetization as an example many companies attempt to modernize their systems by retaining their legacy mainframe and building an api layer on top of it thereby accepting the limitations of the underlying system to respond to the needs of modern business on the other hand one major u s healthcare business is modernizing its sales and marketing applications by replacing its mainframe applications with java based applications using a microservices architecture in the cloud and thereby responding to the market needs of agility flexibility and scalability customer examplea media analysis firm uses microservices to boost agilitya leading media analysis and measurement firm needed to adapt to rapidly changing media consumption trends including the rising utilization of mobile devices to meet the needs of its clients with the proliferation of digital technologies it had been challenging to understand buyer preferences in digital channels to address this the company conceived a system with round the clock listening services capturing consumer data from a variety of digital channels and social media to do so it deployed a loosely coupled modular microservices based architecture enabling efficient data processing on multiple nodes the system is inherently scalable and reliable leveraging aws1 rabbitmq2 an open source message broker for cloud applications and redis3 an open source technology that supports automated database applications in the cloud this cloud based system supports concurrent users with data measurement every seconds it models around domain boundaries to reflect changes in business processes and is highly scalable with the ability to handle large volumes of measurement data four strategic steps to cloud migrationrather than lifting and shifting to save on it overhead companies should move away from their limiting legacy systems by re architecting and transforming monolithic applications to a digital core implementing a cloud empowered digital transformation entails four steps creating a strategy devising an appropriate architecture developing a migration roadmap and cloud migration step establishing a business driven cloud strategyto develop a winning cloud empowered strategy executives need to identify applications and initiatives that that will drive company wide success business drivers include risk the competitive landscape urgent business needs growth opportunities innovation as a differentiator and the potential for developing new lines of business executives also need to examine cloud migration in terms of as is versus the target state prioritizing both immediate opportunities and critical digital transformation needs achieving digital maturity should be a key goal for cloud migration strategies with the proliferation of new critical and powerful technologies digital maturity is essential for aligning the business with transformative business model operations such as those deployed by uber and airbnb and modernized processes adopted in the transportation and finance sectors with respectively automated booking and mobile banking digital maturity consists of building new cloud native capabilities transforming the architecture and leveraging business and contextual knowledge executives should also examine new data opportunities unleashed in the cloud by exploring the possibilities to leverage data as an asset for example by working within a partner ecosystem a company can expose data in a secured manner and regulatory compliant manner to monetize data leveraging cloud native technologies can reveal new revenue streams fueling business growth banks for instance are using data for creating expanded and profitable customer service ecosystems while information services companies are leveraging cloud native technologies to capture their target audience and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns hyper growth is only possible with a clear digital agenda a platform based approach multi cloud integration api implementation and microservices information services companies are leveraging cloud native technologies to capture their target audience and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns hyper growth is only possible with a clear digital agenda a platform based approach multi cloud integration api implementation and microservices step defining the optimal architectureonce the strategy is established the company should turn its attention to cloud architecture defining an optimal architecture ensures that cloud migration is executed in a way that matches the business strategy with regulatory compliance and data security constraints among others depending on these constraints the right architecture may be public private or a hybrid approach key factors to consider include needs for agility scalability availability data sensitivity risk profile innovation time to market and cost for example a healthcare company or financial institution may maintain customer data in a private cloud to ensure the privacy and security of sensitive regulated data and move some of the applications to a public cloud in contrast a retailer may prioritize the ability to scale up and down quickly as demand fluctuates such as at holiday peak times and leverage a public cloud for online services such as netflix or hulu the most important consideration may be availability and failover to prevent customer frustrating outages they may need a microservice based architecture with redundancy to ensure smooth functioning in industries like pharma where innovation is critical the cloud applications with a serverless architecture may deliver the ability to process and analyze data more quickly to meet business needs architecture may also address such factors as how to consolidate data processing from disconnected entities and how to avoid getting locked into any single cloud vendor s platform or it may address the need for geo replicated solutions addressing regional regulatory compliance demands for example a pharmaceutical company may design its cloud architecture to support a globally distributed access management solution with variations to ensure compliance with a complex variety of regional regulations step creating the roadmapin addition to a business driven strategy and an architecture that conforms with a business s needs and market constraints companies should develop a roadmap that ensures a seamless migration to the cloud the roadmap incorporates such factors as how to implement migration with minimal impact on business units or on currently operating it systems it also identifies strategies to follow for analytical applications such as in data lakes and addresses how to handle commercial off the shelf applications such as a company s erp system in addition to a business driven strategy and an architecture that conforms with a business s needs and market constraints companies should develop a roadmap that ensures a seamless migration to the cloud the roadmap incorporates such factors as how to implement migration with minimal impact on business units or on currently operating it systems it also identifies strategies to follow for analytical applications such as in data lakes and addresses how to handle commercial off the shelf applications such as a company s erp system in practice companies tend to address cloud based modernization roadmaps via one of the following four approaches ■ savings first modernization later in this case the company s priority is cutting costs migrate the cost intensive applications and resources to the cloud first and free up the overhead costs of data centers consider the modernization of specific applications at a later stage based on specific business needs this path is usually taken due to constraints such as limited resources security concerns or change management considerations this roadmap is typically chosen by companies with mid size application footprints mostly in the retail hospitality travel and insurance sectors ■ modernization first then business model transformation this roadmap seeks to use the cloud to leverage technological advances to drive current business improvements that transform the business model this roadmap is often chosen by companies with a small application footprint but a strong digital agenda the banking and financial services industry sees this approach playing out for example a nordic bank has modernized its payment applications and transformed the business model leveraging microservices and an apibased architecture a major european bank meanwhile has responded to its market conditions including competition from fintechs as well as new regulatory requirements by seeking to future proof itself with a transformational digital banking strategy it is leveraging cloud apis to create a common ecosystem with partners and other fintechs driving thirdparty innovation that benefits the bank and its ecosystem partners in so doing the bank has defined the future state architecture for api banking its business goals include increasing agility reducing time to market creating new revenue streams and enabling new business models ■ entering the cloud through data services organizations with data lakes and heavy analytical applications are planning to leverage the cloud to modernize their analytical applications here the roadmap begins with modernization and movement to the cloud of their analytical applications the remaining applications may stay on premise or move to the cloud based on a firm s overall cloud strategy for example a major european postal services company has devised a strategy to move their business intelligence applications along with the data marts holding more than terabytes of data to the public cloud and connecting its on premise applications through a dedicated data pipe the strategy for migrating the other applications will be framed parallel to the above initiative ■ enabling a superior last mile experience some businesses with heavy monolithic and legacy commercial off the shelf systems such as erp and crm are looking at the cloud to enable state of the art user experiences for their business with a mobile layer on top of their existing application landscape for example a government insurance business based in the middle east has leveraged cloud native technologies to build a mobile user interface for a selected set of their commercial off the shelf functionalities customer examplea bank uses apification for innovationa leading european bank implemented an apification strategy to innovate more quickly and lay the groundwork for a series of new customer facing apps there were three business drivers for this first to adopt new digital banking business models with a partner ecosystem second to take a leadership position in a changing landscape with increasing competition from fintechs third to comply with the european union s revised payment services directive psd2 the solution included designing an api banking architecture comprised of high level architecture process flows security and data models it leveraged apigee a google api platform and node js an open source server environment the project established an ecosystem to work with partners and fintechs to drive innovation it also created new business models and revenue streams while complying with psd2 regulations step choosing the path to cloud migrationeffective deployment of the cloud strategy and roadmap ensures success of the cloud migration initiative there are three varieties of cloud migration low touch high touch and modernization as illustrated in figure below figure low touch high touch and modernization paths to cloud migrationlow touch migration deals with the lift and shift of applications to the cloud it involves low risk highly automated catalogue based migration services of applications and data this approach has a rapid scale up capability high touch migration involves refactoring of applications i e they can be moved to the cloud with configuration changes and minor modifications or re platforming of applications i e they can be deployed on different operating systems with minor modifications it requires a configurable variable application specific approach with strong transparency in terms of the costs and timeline to completion application modernization services includes applications reengineering new development and is artisanal in nature this leverages what we call business principles the fourth industrial revolution in which successful businesses will use people technology and data to be intelligent agile and automated and on the cloud not easy but worth itimplementing a cloud empowered business modernization effort is a major undertaking for any company it will affect nearly every aspect of the business from front end customer facing applications and processes to back end financial and inventory systems as such there are key barriers that every company must overcome to be successful not surprisingly the effort will demand careful planning to create an appropriate strategy architecture and roadmap a company no matter its size must be prepared to rethink how it addresses its key business drivers based on that it must develop and execute the plan over the course of months and commit sufficient resources to the effort perhaps most importantly the company must create a leadership team with broad support and participation from the c suite operations and affected business units as well as from the tech team it must avoid allowing the it team to drive the process based on its or the company s tactical short term needs a shared vision and thorough buy in from all these stakeholders ensures the best possible outcome once the plan is agreed to the company must verify that it has the requisite tech capabilities and talent to work with its chosen vendor to develop test and implement the project without compromising its ongoing operations and it must do its due diligence to be sure that the vendor has the experience and capacity to help engineer an optimal transformation that will prepare the company for a cloud driven future to help clients achieve their digital transformation the vendors should provide a portfolio of methodologies it must have decision migration and modernization services to help the company achieve its digital transformation with a set of automated accelerators in a factory delivery model and it must offer a full range of capacities to implement microservices serverless architecture containers ecosystem intermediation and hybrid integration finally it must possess business context knowledge to help customers achieve their application transformation and capture new opportunities once cloud migration is complete companies must be organized to innovate and iterate continuously lest the point of the migration be missed with a well designed cloud based digital transformation future innovations will be far easier and quicker to implement customer examplean airline uses a hybrid cloud integration to manage schedulesa leading u s airline deployed hybrid integration to plan crew schedules the business drivers included the need to manage multiple sources of crew information across various domains crew profile planning and operations for various channels and keeping up with federal aviation administration faa rules the airline s solution entailed an enterprise wide platform for integrated crew domain information it eliminated point to point communication and tight coupling between systems and published services for users leveraging a cloud based integration platform as a service ipaas the system enabled the airline to establish automated business rules via this cloud solution the crew can manage its own activities more efficiently and within regulations with operations using multiple channels to oversee their activity a business imperativetechnology is reshaping the world of commerce in profound ways companies like amazon lyft google and netflix are redefining customer expectations and those expectations now apply across their interactions with all industry sectors from hospitality to banking from transportation to entertainment customers expect all their interactions to be seamless they expect the companies with which they interact to respond to them quickly knowing who they are and the history of their past transactions only cloud based solutions offer the agility and power needed to accomplish that we believe that there is simply no way to compete in the modern business world without embracing the cloud and capitalizing on its potential for digital transformation call it future proofing the business companies ignore the cloud at their peril and those who embrace it early and most effectively will be prepared to deliver a superior customer experience while benefiting from a host of operational improvements as we have stressed the key to successfully deploying cloud solutions is developing a strategy architecture and an implementation roadmap that incorporates the company s vital business interests and drivers if the company has not already done so establishing a cross functional team with the authority and capacity to carry out the cloud empowered strategic transformation is an urgent business imperative 1amazon what is docker

73,digital transformations are performed with a range of justifications some stem from a need to replace it systems that have reached the end of their useful life others from a reluctance to spend on a refresh these companies often complex it infrastructures can t keep up with the pace of service demands that leads to lackluster service levels for customers and for mobile workers seeking help with creaky legacy systems and applications that often are fragile prone to breakdowns and neither scalable nor flexible enough to take on new service demands in some cases a company lacks the skills required to tend to its legacy systems creating the risk that it will have trouble keeping them running and as technology vendors move their systems to cloud enabled platforms enterprises that have the on premises versions of those applications eventually will find their vendors support withdrawn other companies embarking on a digital transformation seek a reset they wish to establish a greenfield on which to build a fresh it infrastructure for new ventures and innovative business models often this happens when a company goes through a merger acquisition or divestiture while these events provide a chance to start a fresh computing environment the new entity in all likelihood will be accessing existing data this means that the new entity and its predecessors must ensure the disparate data sets once held by parts of an organization that were together can be managed separately whatever the reason a digital transformation will require any enterprise to shift much of its computing infrastructure from its own data centers to those operated by private or public cloud providers a cloud based digital transformation strategy offers great opportunities ■ reduced costs ■ the chance to capitalize on far greater computational resources provided by cloud providers that run data intensive computing chores■ replacements for aging back office applications■ the flexibility to ramp up or down according to business needs■ the ability to handle the enormous volumes of data coming from internet of things related digital sensors from machines in the field products in customers hands and places of business ■ resources to support the use of artificial intelligence and other systems that identify business opportunities solve operational problems and provide winning digital customer experiences the cloud is full of promise but while straightforward in theory the switchover of systems from a company s data centers to the cloud must be planned carefully if the planning isn t sound it will risk major disruptions to the information systems that the business depends upon every day thus in the absence of considerable forethought a company s digital transformation initiatives are likely to falter because a digital transformation is about the future of the business the planning to support it should hinge on the business s strategy not on it centric concerns executives must focus first on what is relevant to the growth of their business and how a cloud deployment can support that strategy decisions on the technology resources to support that strategy come afterwards and while it shifts systems to the cloud the organization must keep a laser focus on those who will experience the systems that the cloud supports both internal users and customers the cloud beckonsthe debate about whether to join the cloud computing trend is history a survey of nearly it professionals found of their organizations have active cloud implementations and have more than one the cloud is an integral part of digital transformations just as it is central to most modern it programs the move to digital transformation to serve customers better and faster and bring new products and services to market more quickly and frequently requires access to new applications like advanced analytics without them a firms ability to gain needed insights from the data it collects about customers and its own operating performance will be constrained and without the processing power of a public cloud vendor companies will find it difficult to analyze the enormous volume of data that will be generated by internet of things iot sensors traditional it systems are not suited to digital transformations they are not flexible enough they are not responsive enough they are costly to maintain and technology vendors are moving away from supporting their on premises applications corporate leaders can t justify spending more on the it systems they have in place that s pouring good money after bad and so for digital transformations the cloud beckons the question for companies is how to answer the call business strategy guides cloud implementation approach incorporating a cloud computing infrastructure into a company s digital transformation initiative starts with making the business case executives must explain how a cloud infrastructure can support the digital transformation this includes stating how the company s digital transformation will reshape the business for the better how it will empower the company to innovate and grow and how cloud computing will serve as a catalyst the capabilities of a cloud infrastructure should address these questions ■ stability to access resources where and when they are needed a cloud computing provider can ensure the stability of fragile legacy systems ■ flexibility to scale computing resources up or down as demand requires ■ security from private clouds that connect legacy systems via corporate wide area networks and ensure the data security of iot implementations ■ agility a readily accessible test bed for new products and services ■ access to innovative technologies cloud providers host the latest applications updated automatically along with computing resources to gain new insight into data and pursue new initiatives after determining the benefits of a cloud strategy a company s leaders must assess their current environment how ready is the organization s current computing environment what is required to reach the desired future state for each issue below executives need to identify current requirements project future requirements and determine the difference between those desired states and the company s existing conditions issues include ■ business considerations including the company s industry and its existing digital processes for example an industrial manufacturer may be building out an iot system to embed sensors to monitor performance and predict problems in the machines it sells and fix them before they occur that company is likely to have different requirements than a retailer revamping its omnichannel customer experience to reach consumers using smartphone and smart speakers like amazon s alexa each company will have a list of contingencies for its cloud infrastructure to ensure its ongoing operations run smoothly it existing applications are maintained and new capabilities can be accommodated ■ applications including legacy enterprise applications like erp crm supply chain office systems including call center and other communications as well as analytics and other applications that support the business the company needs to understand the specific ramifications for supporting these applications with a new cloud infrastructure and how to ensure continuous service to employees and customers ■ infrastructure the company should outline its existing capabilities and what it will require for the digital transformation this exercise is about laying the foundation for a future in which infrastructure requirements can support future growth by identify gaps between today s reality and the company s vision executives can pinpoint how to close those gaps determining a migration pathwith a vision articulated and an understanding of the business contingencies a cloud infrastructure must include the next step is to determine a path forward the choices executives make whether to go with a public cloud provider a private cloud host or a hybrid model will depend on the business private cloud models such as infrastructure as a service computing resources provided on an as needed basis and platform as a service tools hosted on a cloud platform that enable teams to develop and test new applications products and services are often better suited to companies moving deliberately toward the cloud in addition public cloud providers such as amazon web services microsoft azure and google offer scalability for dynamic burst the ability to handle processing chores during peak volume times such as a retailer s holiday season e commerce orders software as a service providers such as salesforce com s customer relationship management applications host specific business capabilities and related data executives should also consider whether hybrid clouds a model that combines elements of public and private cloud resources are right for their digital transformation the model is a popular choice because companies can run versions of their existing systems while taking advantage of the best of additional resources and technologies for every migration path a company evaluates executives should perform a total cost of ownership analysis that includes the costs of labor technology and other expenses compared to existing conditions as well as calculating projections for the expected returns the swiss army knife nature of cloud infrastructuresthe digital transformations ongoing at two very different businesses show how the versatility of cloud infrastructures can support a range of initiatives private cloud stabilizes company at risk sets stage for rebound the story of a delivery and logistics company shows how a successful cloud migration plan can enable a digital transformation the company which serves large but sparsely populated regions faced complaints about poor service the company s creaky systems had trouble dealing with seasonal demand spikes competition from other logistics firms ate into the company s business the firm saw its orders drop during the first years of the 21st century it was in danger of going out of business at issue was the company s legacy systems which could not change as the environment around the company changed somehow it had to stabilize its legacy systems while its executives planned a larger digital transformation to meet new market demands with a private cloud the company s users could access important applications that previously were prone to breaking down the private cloud also drove an early victory the launch of a digital platform on which business transformation applications could be built in an agile model the system added new functionality while improving customer service the company continued to plan for the future as it built on this early success it created new value added services like booking online appointments for collection and delivery services now the company is more agile than before it can meet seasonal spikes and its existence is no longer in doubt discrete cloud environments establish integrity of parent company and its spinoffthe second example illustrates the opportunity a cloud implementation presents when a large industrial company decides to spin off a business when executives at the manufacturer decided to split off part of itself into a new company each entity needed to have its own it infrastructure complete with separate systems and independent data stores the scale of the original company s systems made this complicated more than business applications including business analytics and financial management systems systems for critical business processes including manufacturing supply chain finance and hr and legacy systems including multiple regional instances of oracle e business suite for erp crm and supply chain management the original company had petabytes of data that had to be segregated and moved during the divestiture process and the migration to two new computing environments had to meet a tight deadline one business quarter while complying with government financial regulations and security requirements the company relied on tcs enterprise private cloud to make the divestiture work it established separate infrastructures for the two companies each company set up its own instance of oracle e business suite each unit also established control of all data relevant to its business the divestiture transaction was completed on time with each company beginning operations on the planned date each supported by its own cloud computing infrastructures finishing touches requiredas the examples of companies using cloud infrastructures to enable dramatic changes illustrate cloud implementations alter the workings of every important system that employees and customers touch creating the conditions for a successful cloud migration requires collaboration among decision makers those implementing changes and employees who will be working in new digital environments some of the challenges that need to be overcome in successful transformations include ■ regulatory compliance like the divestiture noted above cloud infrastructure implementations must follow applicable accounting rules relating to financial data as well as privacy rules for customer information this requires close collaboration between business stakeholders and cloud infrastructure partners the parties must validate compliance before the systems go live for example they need to confirm the datasets that correspond to each business entity are stored properly in the correct systems and applications ■ security compliance in the transition to a cloud infrastructure the company and its cloud partner must confirm that data is handled in compliance with government rules corporate policies and customer agreements for example security features can include data encryption and monitoring data access in addition to the network and system security features that a cloud provider should provide ■ change management the migration to a cloud infrastructure should incorporate all the training and change management efforts that go into any successful it implementation influencing business processes and the work of end users a host for transformationsdigital transformations are a boardroom imperative the issue is one of the top three priorities for in out of industries according to a gartner survey of cios across countries international data corp predicts spending on digital initiatives will grow to close to trillion in and surpass trillion by 3but while digital transformations are a priority success is elusive only of global companies had met or exceeded their digital goals according to a bain and company survey of more than companiesless than half the success rate for conventional transformations 4one thing that is certain the ability of cloud infrastructures to support transformation

74,today digital customer experience transformations are mandatory to stay ahead in business not optional customers are demanding cutting edge digital experiences delivered on every channel via every device anytime and anywhere they desire to satisfy these customers companies are transforming their digital platforms processes and practices leveraging new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence and implementing lean approaches and design thinking but although digital transformations are required they are not risk free these transformational projects generate a dizzying array of new cybersecurity risks new digital processes generate mountains of customer data much of this data is stored inside the organization some is shared with business partners more data stored in multiple places provides a bigger softer target for external hackers and internal bad actors the stakes are high any breach or leak of customer data can cost significant money to address it also can incur the wrath of regulators and do serious damage to a company s reputation consequently any company embarking on the digital transformation of their customer experience must make cybersecurity an integral part of their organizational culture every new touchpoint brings new risksright now companies are supplying their customers with billions of digital apps devices and smart internet connected products kitchen appliances medical devices cars that together comprise the internet of things iot and every new app device and gizmo accesses and generates data traditionally companies stored data both customer and transactional in a centralized and controlled manner within the company s four walls in databases that were guarded and protected today that kind of control is impossible and not even desirable data is generated everywhere all the time flowing into the organization from millions of distributed devices in the hands of customers and partners not to mention from sensors critical to business operations in sectors ranging from retail to telecommunications to manufacturing these connected devices are proliferating at an astonishing rate according to gartner there will be billion connected devices in use worldwide by more than double the number deployed at the end of 1each of these connected digital devices serves as a touchpoint through which companies and customers interact for purposes of marketing sales customer service payments and more and each of these billions of touchpoints represents a potential point of attack that people with bad intentions either criminal hackers or disgruntled employees can exploit data theft or misuse not only constitutes a reputational and financial risk to corporations but could have disruptive impact on customers lives for example ■ in wired warned that connected medical equipment from sensors and monitors to implantable devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps were all vulnerable to hack attacks once they gain access hackers could steal medical records execute ransomware attacks or even cause a device to malfunction so that for example a patient might receive a fatal overdose of insulin 2■ white hat hackers publicized the fact in that they had been able to access the infotainment system including microphone navigation system and speakers on certain volkswagen and audi models as automakers move forward with plans for hands free driving and eventually fully autonomous vehicles the health and safety implications of hack attacks on connected cars becomes realistically dire ■ more and more consumers are stocking their homes with iot devices including baby monitors security cameras doorbells and thermostats but researchers at israel s ben gurion university found that the security protocols on such off the shelf iot devices were easily breached indeed there are anecdotal reports of malevolent strangers hacking into baby monitors to shout insults at children and their parents play music or hijack control of the camera 5■ at the mobile world congress americas an iot security expert conducted a live hack attack on a fictional home with multiple iot devices quickly taking control of an amazon echo ip camera smart alarm and smart lock to gain physical access to the home this scenario is especially troubling given berg insight s prediction that more than half of all homes in north america will become smart homes by the year 7pouring money into the wrong bucketscompanies know that cybersecurity risks are rising they want to protect themselves and their customers so they are ramping up their cybersecurity spending idc predicts that spending on security related hardware software and services will reach billion worldwide in a percent increase over spending on cybersecurity will continue to soar over the next three years especially in the telecommunications sector where idc projects a cagr in cybersecurity investments but are companies making the right sort of cybersecurity investments we believe that in the absence of a new strategy cybersecurity simply increasing the size of the cybersecurity spend will not be sufficient to cope with the magnitude of the threat at hand here are four reasons why companies cannot rely on more of the same when it comes to cybersecurity reactive solutions are no longer sufficient cybersecurity practitioners have traditionally focused on detecting problems and then reacting to them with countermeasures this strategy no longer suffices in as hackers can now do more damage more quickly and have become more adept at hiding their tracks data is everywhere and it is largely unstructured legacy cybersecurity models focused on protecting structured data that lived within a corporate database but now data is unstructured coming into the enterprise a wide variety of formats from word files and spreadsheets to images videos audio and more in addition critical corporate data now resides everywhere in the cloud and on billions of devices scattered across the planet according to gartner there will be billion internet connect things by one cannot erect a firewall around every individual with a smartphone or laptop or digital assistant everywhere in the world companies no longer own the devices that hold their data before the iot cybersecurity teams could focus on hardening defenses around a select group of internal it systems data centers and networks but today there are billions of iot devices each a potential entry point for an attacker for example target suffered a damaging breach after hackers gained access to its payment systems and stole login credentials through an internet connected hvac system 10for a hacker any iot device could be the back door to the larger system in a hospital it could be an internet connected mri machine or ct scanner in a household it could be an appliance or a digital assistant recently researchers have demonstrated their ability to eavesdrop and record voices of people using amazon s popular alexa enabled echo speaker 11and it s not just devices even browsers or apps can give hackers a way into the enterprise today it is no longer possible to draw a bright line around where the corporate network begins or ends existing strategies cannot meet new regulatory requirements the regulatory landscape is shifting underfoot unnerved by the vast attack on u s credit bureau equifax that exposed the personally identifiable information of approximately million americans and disturbed by the way social media companies have sold access to user data without their users knowledge or permission governments are promulgating ever stricter privacy regulations and laws in the eu the general data protection regulation gdpr went into effect on may requiring organizations with users or customers in the eu to do a better job of protecting customers personal data this has forced many u s companies to re write their privacy policies and in some cases de identify and encrypt data they already possess in addition individual countries are passing their own privacy regulations forcing companies to store data on their citizens within those countries national borders as a result corporations that once consolidated as much data as possible within a single controlled location must now operate and secure multiple data warehouses all over the world this proliferation of data centers both magnifies overhead costs and increases the complexity of blocking hackers from gaining access to steal data or otherwise wreak havoc making cybersecurity an integral part of the strategy to transform the digital customer experiencegoing forward a successful cybersecurity strategy will need to have four components instead of focusing on a warehouse a facility a geography or a system cybersecurity must bedata centric that is the company must commit to protecting its data and its customers data wherever it resides cybersecurity strategy must becomeflexible regulations will continue to change connected devices will proliferate data will continue to multiply a company s cybersecurity strategy must be able to change dynamically cybersecurity must put a major emphasis on predictive capabilities ideally companies should have the cybersecurity capabilities to identify and mitigate risks before they become a problem what s better than stopping a hacker in his or her tracks stopping the hack attack from occurring in the first place big data and analytics tools have a major role to play in pinpointing problematic transactions and probing intrusions so that companies can take steps to shut down emergent threats it must be inclusive encompassing the protection of both the company s intellectual property as well as its customer data protecting the organization s data from cyber attacks starts with an understanding of the internal and external vulnerabilities your business faces having a well rounded strategy and approach coupled with proactive threat hunting will enable organizations to focus their resources on the entry points where hackers can gain entry to systems risk analysis baked into the designtoo few organizations use a risk based approach when considering which digital systems to implement rather than trying to wrap a security blanket around an inherently vulnerable system companies should make sure that cybersecurity experts have a key role in designing building and testing the digital systems and processes used to safeguard ip protect customer data and keep companies in regulatory compliance gone are the days when companies could relegate cybersecurity strategy to their it departments this is a business issue organizations need to employ an approach that integrates cyber protection into all aspects of the organization from employee training to sales to finance to operations complying with regulations weighing the costsas noted the eu s new gdpr regulations place new privacy and data protection responsibilities onto corporations obviously companies must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where they do business but as new cybersecurity rules multiply and come into force companies may need to make some hard decisions about whether it makes financial and strategic sense to do business in certain countries for example some countries are now passing laws saying data on their citizens must reside within their borders companies will need to calculate the costs and benefits of complying with those rules ■ what are the financial costs of setting up these new distributed data centers ■ will the company need to make major changes to its cybersecurity strategy or protocols to move from a few centralized data centers to many far flung facilities ■ will the logistical and operational challenges of securing these multiple data centers distract the cybersecurity team from focusing on other more important threats to its core systems in some cases it could make sense for a company to pull back from noncore markets or countries rather than incur the additional costs risks and distractions of complying with especially burdensome regulations prioritize then pursueevery system has flaws every program has bugs the key is to figure out which flaws and bugs are mere annoyances and which are existential threats whether a company s data lives in a data center or a cloud computing environment the cybersecurity team must be adept at identifying the most significant risks and prioritizing fixes based on two criteria does the risk represent a threat to core business operations in other words if a system goes down or is taken offline will the result be a minor annoyance or a major disaster will the repercussions be a minor embarrassment or a major hit to the stock price could the threat involve customer data especially personally identifiable information pii if hackers get access to customers names emails addresses and birth dates that might not have any discernable effect on day to day operations but it could cause devastating reputational damage and lead to unpleasant regulatory legal and political repercussions by assessing whether threats overlap with either of these two red flag areas core business operations and or pii customer data cybersecurity teams will know where to focus their efforts other issues can wait these are the threats that must be addressed immediately challenges people skills and frameworkscybersecurity teams must overcome two key challenges if they hope to keep their organizations safe from disaster finding and training the right people currently companies are having difficulty hiring and training people fast enough to keep up with the pace of change in the cybersecurity world according to a recent workforce report there will be a million person shortfall by in cybersecurity talent 12threats are evolving faster and faster each new technology comes with a steep learning curve yet at the same time each new cybersecurity tool has a shorter shelf life than the previous generation hardwarebased firewalls were the foundation of cybersecurity for a decade but have now given way to software defined networks where everything is virtual including the firewall the most important skill that cybersecurity professionals need today is the ability to orchestrate collect and interpret data from multiple security tools they need to filter the information and figure out where to take action first according to the prioritization methods outlined above to address the shortfall of cyber security talent organizations will have to invest on in house talent development programs and leverage digital technologies for virtual training investments in robust training content and virtual labs on cloud for hands on trainings are key to a successful talent development program building a robust rules based framework security organizations typically find themselves deluged by detected threats but as noted not all risks deserve equal attention some can be safely ignored or at least put on the back burner others require the undivided instant attention of first responders companies can significantly reduce their cybersecurity risks by making sure they have a strong rules based framework in place to help team members properly prioritize security threats and responses some sample prioritization rules could include ■ prioritize threats to systems that are critical to business operations including financial and customer transactions ■ prioritize threats to systems and databases that contain pii as breaches in those areas would expose the company to regulatory and reputational damages ■ prioritize repairs in systems that connect to the internet as they are vulnerable to external hackers who can then move horizontally to access a business s entire network or outward to interfere with customer systems cybersecurity departments will never have infinite resources or infinite time to fix known problems so having this type of clear comprehensive rules based framework plays a critical role in making sure that team members rank risks appropriately and use their time wisely to mitigate the most severe threats start with securitythe overarching challenge facing corporate security leaders today may not be new customers and users have always wanted maximum access and availability and bad actors have always probed for ways to defeat defenses but what is new is that the opportunities for mischief and the vectors for crime have multiplied with data residing everywhere and increasingly outside the four walls of the business we live and work in an ever expanding universe of vulnerabilities with every point in that universe connected to another this is both the strength and the weakness of modern technology driven business this increasingly robust and useful web of connected systems and devices presents businesses with a tremendous opportunity to develop new customer experiences to meet expectations and delight consumers but it also demands that enterprises embed cybersecurity considerations into the design development and testing of these new experiences and the digital products and services that make them possible the best and most cost effective time to consider the cybersecurity consequences of all these innovative products services and experiences is at the beginning when they are still a gleam in the business s eye and before something bad happens they say that prevention is worth a pound of cure that s never been truer than it is today gartner says billion connected things will be in use in up percent from press release february accessed at devices are

75,internet of things iot technologies present businesses with unprecedented opportunities the iot enables companies to embed digital technology into the products they sell creating new value streams and new aftermarkets it drives supply chains that turn components into products and bring them to market creating new top and bottom line efficiencies it can track and reveal consumer preferences and behaviors generating new insights and improved digital customer experiences that produce loyalty and new revenue and that just scratches the surface iot technologies are increasingly are found in products ranging from refrigerators to aircraft engines small digital cameras attached to the inside and outside of buildings think of retail stores and amusement parks digital bracelets that customers wear and which let a company know where the customer is on its premises such as at a theme park iot technologies allow companies to ■ understand how their products are performing by analyzing usage data companies can improve product performance and predict when they need service before they break down allowing companies to offer new services that customers can depend upon ■ track the movement and actions of customers on the company s premises and enhance their experience by for example reorganizing queues and offering add on services that will ease access to high traffic areas ■ monitor employees and their interactions with customers so that for example retail workers and managers can brainstorm to slash wait times at checkout these capabilities exemplify a closed loop system in which a company can combine the performance data it collects from the field with data from its other systems erp supply chain financial crm systems and more to better serve customers a closed loop system moves a company from static and reactive to dynamic and proactive from relying on historic information to basing decisions on real time data thus the iot is an enabler of what we call business the modern state of business in which firms can use abundant data agile approaches to business automation technologies and computing resources to drive their enterprises with the realization that the iot delivers value while enriching customer experiences many companies have been spending big money on iot initiatives… all with the best intentions and hopes that they are pursuing the highest value opportunities worldwide spending on internet of things projects will reach an estimated billion in up percent from with investment forecast to reach trillion in according to international data corp 1but we think many of these investments will prove to be suboptimal not because iot technologies aren t transformative they are but rather because its opportunities are so varied and numerous it s hard to know where to begin and many businesses begin in the wrong places to turn iot technologies into a profitable strategic initiative means not only understanding how these systems can transform business models it also means building a business case that takes best advantage of the technology to deliver benefits to a company s customers so both they and the company profit the useful use case monitoring the business and the customerexecutives confronting the question of which iot opportunities to pursue and in what order should start by identifying a broad range of applications and use cases for deploying sensors and collecting data for analysis with more use cases to evaluate the task becomes rank ordering which initiatives will generate the greatest business value we have found an effective evaluation method classifies iot use cases into four types product monitoring aircraft engine manufacturers such as ge and rolls royce have been embedding sensors in their products for years to report on their performance samsung has introduced a smart refrigerator with internal cameras producing images accessible via a smartphone app so that a shopper at the grocery store can see if there s milk in his refrigerator or whether he needs to pick up a half gallon 2value product monitoring can create servitization business models transforming companies from product sellers to service providers that rent their products while earning continuing revenue from the product and the service for example a pump manufacturer can offer a zerodowntime guarantee after installing sensors in its equipment to detect problems and fix them before a breakdown occurs customer monitoring vacationers at the disney world resort in orlando fla wear magicband bracelets that unlock hotel rooms pay for food and merchandise and allow guests to gain access to attractions3 a system which represented a reported billion investment4 similarly carnival corp has introduced an electronic medallion personalized for cruise ship guests to buy services during their trip 5value customer monitoring enables firms to gauge interest in their product and service offerings in real time shift resources dynamically and quickly in response to shifts in demand identify ways to enhance the customer experience and offer add on services supply chain monitoring embedding digital sensors and cameras in manufacturing warehousing and distribution operations enables companies to track the flow of raw materials parts and products manufacturers of all kinds from pharmaceuticals to automotive parts to food and consumer products can implement track and trace projects to identify supply chain problems and opportunities for improvement while mitigating risks and finding cost savings value analysis of iot generated data brings real time intelligence to even the most extended and complicated supply chains in an increasingly globalized world that data and capability is not a nice tohave it is a must have premises monitoring retailers and fast food restaurants increasingly are installing digital sensors and cameras to track their customers movement and actions to shorten lines and improve their experience security firms monitor facilities or homes to mitigate risks monitoring can also be used for energy optimization in manufacturing homes office buildings and so on value analysis of premises data provides insights on space utilization and reveals opportunities for improving traffic flow or capturing customers attention many initiatives like these have generated big returns however if companies keep their iot initiatives siloed within these four areas they will be putting the technology and their businesses in a straight jacket companies need to identify and size the opportunities that bridge those four silos to create larger opportunities for example how could an iot initiative at an electric utility company connect product customer supply chain and premises monitoring if the utility sells solar power systems to homeowners and businesses it could combine product monitoring premises monitoring and customer monitoring in combination by ■ installing digital sensors in the solar systems to track their energy production product monitoring ■ tracking the production at the location of each solar customer premises monitoring ■ determining difference between solar energy produced and electricity used at individual customer sites customer monitoring ■ predicting how much energy could be sold to other customers on the grid based on analysis of solar energy production and customer consumption patterns the iot devices in this scenario would enable the utility to go far beyond simply metering its services it would be able to establish and manage a cloud based energy marketplace that enables its customers to sell power to one other creating a closed loop system and a virtuous and profitable circle utilities can create still greater value by combining real time data from multiple iot systems to their enterprise systems to produce a connected digital enterprise this could provide consumers with benchmarks of their energy consumption compared to similar consumers advising them via analytics how to optimize their energy use this would also allow the utility to plan grid load management proactively and predictively how to tap even greater value from the iotwhen companies build bridges across siloes and combine those connections with the products of analytics they can generate new kinds of business value we have seen companies realize this value in five ways the customer complexity reducer by installing sensors in a place of business and connecting them to devices that customers hold companies can use iot technologies to remove the friction that customers face when they conduct business on a company s premises for example the amazon go store that opened in seattle in uses digital cameras in the store artificial intelligence a smartphone app and other technologies that eliminate the need for cashiers or checkout stations and checkout lines customers just pick up the items they want put them in bags and carry them out the store s systems track what they remove from shelves and charge their account accordingly 6amazon s system combines customer monitoring product monitoring and premises monitoring to eliminate transactional friction improve the customer experience and differentiate itself in the marketplace a powerful strategy the operations enhancer by monitoring supply chains and tracking onpremise events companies can identify and eliminate costly inefficiencies while preventing stockouts or shutdowns that can lead to lost revenue for example oil refineries that depend upon consistent up time save millions by combining supply chain with premises surveillance to avoid shutdowns the same business value principle applies to factories that can track incoming supplies and outgoing products while monitoring their warehouses the product differentiator by tracking the performance of a product in real time after a customer purchases it a manufacturer can do predictive maintenance and also offer add on services for example the company offers a performance guarantee for the product because it has real time tracking data for it and can offer other performance related services such as free product optimization service that help customers get better value the arrangement also enables a manufacturer to differentiate its product from others in the marketplace as tesla has done with its streaming upgrades offered on a tiered subscription basis this combines product monitoring with customer usage monitoring enabled by analytics the servitization enabler a growing number of manufacturers are selling connected products and thus making it possible to turn those products into services generating recurring revenue from products that are rented rather than marginal profit from items sold ge and rolls royce are doing this with aircraft engines selling power by the hour to some customers michelin is doing it with truck tires renting its tires by the mile driven kaeser kompressoren a century old machinery manufacturer based in coburg germany sells air compressors as a service using iot after developing a predictive maintenance program for its machines 9as the compressor illustration suggests data analytics is central to the servitization model that combines product performance and customer usage monitoring a manufacturer can install sensors in its products and monitor customer use but without quality analytics to gain real time intelligence into performance to close the loop with the customer the service is likely to flounder the data monetizer by capturing data and analyzing customer usage patterns companies can look to sell it to third parties abiding by terms of service agreements with customers the data monetizer also can be an internally focused business model for example a manufacturer of power generation equipment or an electrical utility that demonstrates superior efficiencies could sell data it compiles about its performance to other utilities looking for lessons on optimizing their own operations determining your iot opportunitieswe recommend executives create their iot opportunity roadmap by following these four steps that narrow the wide range of options to those that will have the best chance to deliver meaningful returns identify relevant use cases examine business operations from supply chain to sales to after sale service look at the kinds of products the company sells whether they have sensors in them now whether they can be so equipped whether customers smartphones represent existing or untapped connections take inventory of the company s data analytics capabilities the kinds of data it collects and the gaps that may exist how well the company uses analytics now and whether its capabilities can be improved after examining these criteria with all five iot opportunity areas in mind make a list of potential areas where iot could deliver value estimate the costs and benefits of each option this step should include research with business stakeholders including customers to corroborate the use case details test original assumptions specify investments required for each use case estimate the returns on each investment prioritize the list of opportunities based on clear criteria for each potential initiative specify the roi the risks involved estimated time to completion the feasibility of the project both technical and cultural and any other factors that business stakeholders identify determine the key requirements for executing each initiative this includes not only the data required to make the initiative a reality but also the latency of that data how close to real time the data must be for the use case to be profitable for example if the latency required is low a company will need to have the capabilities to provide near real time data to analyze a product s performance or a customer s use of a product other factors include the skills needed to design test implement and refine the system the technologies needed such as the sensors applications analytics and iot architecture to support the initiative and training that employees or customers will require executives going through this checklist would be wise to pay special attention to their current analytics capabilities like any initiative involving analytics a successful iot program will require strong data management processes common data access roadblocks that must be overcome include missing data data locked up in old infrastructures and proprietary systems as well as unusable unstructured data of course companies must ensure the security of data they include in iot systems channeling ideas in profitable directionscompanies don t fail with iot because they lack ideas they fail when they pursue too many initiatives in an uncoordinated way so that the highest value opportunities do not get the appropriate resources this problem is exacerbated when data is siloed hampering the organization s ability to marshal all its resources to move iot innovations beyond the proof of concept stage companies need an iot business strategy that determines which of the five business values of iot makes most sense to them customer complexity reducer operations enhancer product differentiator servitization enabler and or data monetizer one only hits the bullseye if that s all one sees and all one aims

76,the launch was supposed to spur excitement a large bank redesigned its personal banking web pages to attract new customers and generate more business from existing customers instead the revamped website was an embarrassment pages loaded slowly for customers using the chrome web browser website traffic dipped to a record low instead of elevating the customer experience the redesign damaged the bank s reputation and brand when a customer interacts with a digital product or service she is not thinking about using a tool touching a smartphone clicking a keyboard or swiping a tablet screen she is buying products and services or getting information a single hiccup in the process a touch click or swipe that fails to yield the expected result quickly becomes a reason not to proceed executives in charge of developing and presenting these digital customer experiences must make these processes seamless they must deliver great quality service every time reliably whether the customer is using a mobile phone laptop or desktop computer smart speaker or digital device the experience must do the job as designed and deliver results quickly ensuring that requires thinking differently about engineering the digital experience quality engineering an approach that relies on agile devops and processes that automate the quality assurance process enables companies to ensure that customer experiences on websites and apps perform right the first time in other words quality engineering is a catalyst for enhanced cx the growing challenge of customer expectationsthe bank s website disaster was not atypical many organizations are not providing the digital experiences their customers expect sixty nine percent of customer experiences in the u s in were just ok according to a forrester research study of online consumers interacting with brands in industries in that study consumers ranked of their experiences good and only as excellent nearly one out of four were rated poor or very poor a delay in website response can be fatal to customer experience improvements researchers at google found it takes about seconds to load a typical mobile web page on a smartphone that may sound slow but it is worse than slow in consumers minds many will leave a mobile website long before that average mobile website loading speeds for u s based firms vary by industry health care firms were best at seconds while technology firms posted times of seconds that s not good enough all are at risk of losing their users security is also crucial to creating a quality customer experience not enough firms are validating the security of their customer facing applications some of professionals who develop customer experience applications said their firms had not taken steps to guard against hacking of their mobile or iot applications according to a ponemon institute survey of it and application security practitioners in the same survey said their organization s mobile apps had been breached many organizations treat security as an afterthought said their organization typically waits until their systems are in production to test the security of iot applications while said they usually wait until production to test mobile application security another notable characteristic of top performing customer experiences they account for those who may have a vision or hearing impairment or other physical or intellectual challenge organizations that do not accommodate these users increasingly risk being sued for discrimination in the united states there have been more than lawsuits against companies in retail hospitality and financial services industries alleging violations of laws protecting those who have physical and intellectual challenges in the world of digital experiences things are not likely to get easier customer expectations continue to rise as they embrace the latest mobile apps that use automated technologies and artificial intelligence these digital experiences raise everyone s expectations and even if a digital application doesn t incorporate the latest technologies customers expect the systems to work just like their smartphones simply easily and they expect their digital experiences will be private and secure companies are betting their futures on their ability to develop new enticing and sticky digital interfaces on time without glitches in functionality or performance they are continuously launching new systems and updating existing customer channels websites must cater to different browsers mobile apps must appear on different smartphone platforms voice activated products like amazon alexa and google home need to be sophisticated at recognizing and answering voice commands interfaces need to be embedded in devices and appliances in customer homes businesses cars and all the other locations where they live work and play these many avenues for access generate complexity and when one considers that each channel must handle multiple systems e g various iphone and android versions complexity increases and avenues to failure proliferate to overcome these hurdles companies must go beyond quality assurance to what we call quality engineering delivering an enhanced customer experience through the quality engineering route enables an enterprise to meet three key imperatives taking an automation first approach across the whole engineering value chain centering the quality engineering approach around the customer experience creating an efficient tools strategy for the test environment to further automation that improves the customer experience the barriers to achieving these requirements lie in the shortcomings of today s quality assurance approaches the problem with traditional quality assurancetraditionally companies set up processes for quality assurance teams to test their customer facing applications these processes were appropriate when they were first developed but in today s rapid development environment these quality assurance processes take too long to get results what s more they often fail to catch system compatibility glitches that derail the experiences of entire customer groups traditional approaches typically focus only on parts of a customer experience rather the end to end process think of a retailer whose omnichannel experience includes in store online and mobile traditional quality assurance approaches also can fail to account for the interactions among different applications and services both existing and new and whether they are compatible with or disruptive to the customer experience or how the customer experience in one channel relates to all the other channels a company uses and while some organizations have benefited simply by executing tests earlier in the development lifecycle an adjustment called shift left the larger quality challenges remain unaddressed quality engineering takes a different direction quality engineering enhancing the cxquality engineering is a superior method for ensuring that customer experiences on websites and mobile apps perform right the first time and every time the approach recognizes that as enterprise applications including those connected to new apps and customer facing systems continue to grow in complexity companies need a cost effective tool agnostic platform that can orchestrate software releases quality engineering enables the adoption of agile and devops development approaches these approaches enable an organization to design develop test and deliver applications rapidly repeatedly and with tools and technologies that automate the quality assurance process holistically quality engineering starts with establishing holistic automation processes that embrace a customer centric mindset in every application design choice and software programming decision this means procedures measure customer experience performance according to such considerations as ■ how the system operates and whether it performs according to expectations such as speed and reliability ■ how the customer experiences its performance■ how a specific feature or design fits into the entire customer experience relative to a company s other offerings■ how a specific feature or design relates to the customer s life and work experiencebefore using a quality engineering approach companies first should compare their cx to industry best practices and determine how to address the weaknesses they find they should ask what stands in the way of increasing speed to market for new and superior customer experiences answers to these questions will help them focus a quality engineering program on such elements as ■ cx quality evaluation to assess and remediate enterprise applications that serve customers correlating results with key process indicators■ technology infrastructure that supports automated systems testing and assesses how cx services perform with a wide range of customer devices browsers and operating systems■ testing for security and regulatory compliance including the safety of personal information and meeting rules related to privacy and differently able user access■ ease of use testing with a focus on end to end customer journeys through channels such as a mobile apps mobile websites or websites accessed from a desktop computer■ testing for best in class performance to measure response times for user clicks and transactions benchmarked against top performersrecent ai advances are vital in quality engineering programs enabling companies to evaluate large systems with numerous potential errors and flaws rapidly ai enabled tools can analyze and test customer experience systems much faster than conventional ones and quickly zero in on problems the approach is designed to include new factors as they come online whether they be chatbots new social network connections and more to ensure these functions work for customers as intended how to get quality engineering rightin our experience a holistic quality engineering program must address an array of issues including the deployment of agile approaches and devops to automate much of the work and improve its effectiveness before it can be implemented successfully quality engineering covers five dimensions compatibility tests ensure an application runs uniformly across all digital mediums for example a life insurance policy quote can be started on a tablet and completed seamlessly on a mobile phone usability testing addresses quantitative validations like task times error rates compared to industry standards and guidelines on such aspects as human computer interaction addressing navigation presentation content and interaction are the changes between web pages logical and easy for a customer to follow does the customer get the information he requested usability also covers visual consistency across screens for example an online retailer planning for peak activity during a black friday sale must ensure its digital channels are providing fast seamless navigation among different web pages precise content in response customer requests and auto fill capabilities on payment forms to speed the purchase and check out process accessibility testing ensures inclusive assurance it verifies digital assets against the world wide web consortium s web content accessibility guidelines for example a mobile banking app should be built with accessibility features like alternative text that describe objects that appear on a screen good contrast ratios and visible focus indicators that enable a customer to use a keyboard instead of a mouse to access links search boxes and other features performance testing examines the fluidity of user experiences such as search comparing alternatives offerings as well as the ability to select order schedule delivery and pay instantaneously different channels such as mobile and web require their own testing for example a retailer planning for a large online sale tied to an event needs best inclass response times and load times for its channels to prevent crashes during peak demand security testing examines the fluidity of user experiences such as search comparing alternatives offerings as well as the ability to select order schedule delivery and pay instantaneously different channels such as mobile and web require their own testing for example a retailer planning for a large online sale tied to an event needs best inclass response times and load times for its channels to prevent crashes during peak demand what great quality engineering looks likewhen you look behind the scenes of organizations that have successfully implemented quality engineering programs and processes you see the problems that did not make it out into the world these organizations caught these flaws and fumbles before they reached customers both internal and external the examples below quantify the problems and risks avoided through quality engineering repairing customized systems before launch not after situation a new york based media and information company was customizing its salesforce application to serve as both a crm and an erp system for planning forecasting and financial management quality engineering impact testing processes identified flaws before the company implemented the system problems uncovered included ■ accessibility quality engineering impac defects across web pages tested on four browsers ■ usability quality engineering impac defects identified across seven major task screens■ browser compatibility quality engineering impac urls with different content when viewed with four different browsersresult an improved customer experience for the media company s users the company adopted techniques like automated cross browser testing to correct these issues before moving the system into production saving time and money testing improves the product performance before customers see it live situation in preparation for the pilot launch of a new financial product a u s based insurance and financial services company needed to test elements that went into creating the product including the web application critical infrastructure and middleware quality engineering impact the testing process identified flaws the company addressed which reduced security risks and enabled it to meet web accessibility standards result by identifying flaws pre launch the company reduced its information security costs by and by identifying browser compatibility and accessibility issues the firm corrected those issues before launch saving time and money quality engineering the way to meet evolving customer expectationscustomers will not wait for companies even well known brands to fix a

77,how leading cmos are using digital technology to personalize communications and boost roi throughout the customer lifecycleannouncing the tcs chief marketing officer studytoday s chief marketing officers are under pressure to improve performance with smaller budgets in the united states marketing spending as a percentage of revenue across b2c and b2b firms fell over the last five years shortening the tenure for cmos among their peers in the c suite this changing climate for cmos is being driven by digital technologies and tcs is taking an in depth look at the cmo in the digital age with the tcs chief marketing study our goal is to understand how leading companies are using digital technology to dramatically improve the customer brand experience and increase revenue and retention ultimately we want to help cmos at large companies better understand how the most successful marketing functions are harnessing digital technologies to increase revenue profitability and customer value from our work with cmos at many of the world s biggest companies it s clear that this research couldn t come at a better time our study has been in the research design and planning phase for months so that we can bring new and important insights to the market in this essay we give cmos a sneak preview of the issues that tcs will be shedding light on this spring when we bring our findings to the market we predict our research will show many prevailing beliefs about best marketing practices in the digital realm are no longer relevant digital everywherethe stark reality for cmos today is this digital technology is now at the core of marketing and many – but not all – once sacrosanct marketing practices are being questioned the demands of the cmo role have also increased sharply because digital technology now permeates nearly every aspect of what marketing departments do even the creative side of marketing is increasingly influenced by digital technology for example artificial intelligence technologies are used increasingly to help marketers ferret crucial real time insights and analytics about customer needs wants and behaviors many traditional marketing investments are now impediments to attracting and retaining profitable customers including the following ■ marketing budgets spent simply to create awareness of an organization s products and services■ campaigns personalizing communications at the segment rather than the individual level■ boundaries separating marketers from sales and post sale servicewhat the tcs cmo study will exploreone major issue our study will look at is how the marketing functions of cmos in north america u s and canada and europe uk germany and the netherlands are using digital technologies to personalize communications to prospective and actual customers – all of course in the hope of converting prospects to customers and new customers to loyal customers we will look at consumer marketers b2c business marketers b2b and business to business to consumer marketers b2b2c companies that sell products and services to wholesalers and retailers before they end up in consumers hands we will look at the communications activities of such b2c b2b and b2b2c companies in four generic stages of the customer lifecycle – stages that apply to all companies product and service alike ■ awareness creation■ purchase influence and decision■ post sale customer support including contact center and social media responses ■ repeat and new purchases by current customers i e retained customers here are a few of the many important issues that we will shed light on on the new and evolving digital brand experience■ what communications channels are companies favoring in each of the four stages and do they differ by industry product and service type or other factors ■ how are companies personalizing their communications in these stages and what data and tools are they using to do so ■ does use more channels and having more data lead to better personalization and does better personalization lead to better conversions lower customer churn and greater repeat purchases and profitability ■ what metrics are marketers using to gauge their performance how accurate are those metrics ■ to what degree are marketing functions involved in creating communications across all four generic stages in the customer experience for example are communications in post sale customer service off limits to most marketing functions on marketing s work with other customer – and non customer facing functions■ marketing functions increasingly are sitting on powerful data about customers and their purchasing behaviors want and needs but to what degree are marketers supplying data and insights to sales customer service r d and it and are these other functions actually using and getting value from the data on what skills marketing functions need today■ what skills are important and where are some of the biggest skill gaps on automating and technology in marketing■ how much of marketing s activities are automated today how do cmos expect this change in the near future in short how much marketing activity do cmos believe can be automated vs done manually in the ways they have always been done ■ how complex has the average cmo s marketing stack of technologies become one estimate is that there are nearly marketing software packages from more than companies on the market today has a big stack of marketing technologies become an asset or a liability to marketing innovation ■ how are cmos using analytics in each stage are they using it in one stage more than the others and are they using analytics to understand the behavior of every customer across his or her lifecycle as a customer what the most successful digital marketers do differently■ how do the most and least effective marketing organizations differ on the topics previously mentioned in particular how do they differ in how they personalize communications with customers and with what data and using what channels and how much are marketers reaching out beyond their traditional awareness creation role to playing a crucial role in sales customer service and product enhancement and development■ do companies differ in how they approach consumer privacy and sharing data these are just a few of the issues we ll be exploring in this exciting and important research next steps stay tuned to this digital channelover the next few months we will be collecting input and analyzing data and we ll provide regular insights on the issues above in several formats we believe these insights will shed significant light for cmos everywhere who want to launch more successful marketing campaigns tie marketing to revenue help their companies gain market share and help continue marketing s path in becoming a crucial resource for their organization s sales customer service product development finance and it functions,tcs cmo study executive summary
78,objectivethe tcs chief marketing officer cmo study documents how the most and the least successful cmos in north america and europe are leveraging digital technologies to personalize the customer experience methodologywe surveyed and interviewed more than cmos to uncover how the top performers or leaders and the less effective followers use and plan to use digital technologies in multiple communications channels in four common stages of the customer lifecycle awareness conversion support and retention to increase revenue profitability and value to customers and prospects survey populationthese global companies were a mix of b2c b2b b2b2c with a mix of b2b and b2c the average annual revenue of those surveyed was billion the median was billion the average annual marketing budget was million the median was million digital marketing trendsthe way that large companies are marketing their brands and offerings is in a state of digital metamorphosis mass marketing through analog channels especially broadcast and print media is still happening but digital channels are dominating companies in the digital marketing ecosystem especially facebook google and amazon have unprecedented granular information on consumers and businesses they and wireless communications providers know where these customers are and artificial intelligence infused analytics and other marketing technologies give companies powerful tools to identify potential customers and the ability to tailor messages that turn prospects into customers that buy and keep on buying yet our research is finding that when it comes to using digital personalization technologies effectively most large marketing organizations that we surveyed are not where they need to be only a minority is using digital technologies to personalize communications at every stage of the brand experience customer life cycle although businessto consumer b2c companies are more proficient than business to business b2b companies most are not taking advantage of the customer data available to them the study research indicates that the majority of cmos anticipate migration to the cloud for on premises and off premises and a dramatic increase in the use of automation by across every marketing activity survey findings at a glance1 most marketing organizations do not create communications for each stage of the customer life cycle■ of marketers create communications during the awareness stage ■ only of marketers create communications during the conversion stage ■ only of marketers are involved in personalizing communications during the support stage ■ only of marketers are involved in personalizing communications during the customer retention stage ■ only of the b2b companies surveyed said marketing is involved in digitally personalizing communications with customers in the support stage after prospects become customers ■ only are using geo location data to personalize communications in in the customer retention stage ■ only of marketers that digitally personalize communications in the customer retention stage use customer web traffic data and only uses customer social media data how marketing delivers personalized communications■ in the awareness stage digital channels are used most frequently communications are personalized using primarily demographic data ■ in the conversion stage digital data and digital channels are used to personalize communications ■ during the support stage email and company websites are used to personalize customer communications ■ in the retention stage to get customers to buy more and remain loyal digital ads and company websites are used to personalize messages how analytics are currently being used■ analytics are used most often to convert prospects to customers but far less often to retain customers ■ of the firms who digitally personalize communications during the support stage are leveraging the data around their customers previous buying behavior ■ only of those using customer data at the support stage take advantage of geo location data only leverage data from social media behavior only exploit customer product usage data from sensors embedded in their products only use customer service usage data from company iot sensors ■ of marketers use digital technologies to personalize communications in the support stage by providing order status information how leaders differ from followers■ leaders are more likely to create communications for prospects and customers in every stage of the customer life cycle ■ of leaders are more likely to personalize communications with useful product service information in the awareness stage compared to of followers ■ only of followers are likely to use analytics in the support stage ■ of leaders are more likely to use analytics in the customer retention stage ■ leaders of total sample indicated a much higher than average impact from their marketing investments in one or more of six metrics return on marketing investment revenue by campaign impact on sales and lifetime customer value customer retention and conversion rate and that their metrics were accurate ■ followers of total sample performed poorly on some or all of the six metrics or didn t use those metrics or did use some or all of them but couldn t vouch for their accuracy cmo predictions■ predict that by digital personalization of communications will be more important for attracting new customers than for keeping and cross selling to existing customers ■ but of leaders vs of followers believe that in digitally personalized communications will be most important for current customers in the support and retention stages ■ of all marketers expect automation for data and analytics solutions to increase by compared with automated today ■ marketing activities are becoming heavily automated and shifting to public private clouds overviewchief marketing officers in large north american and european companies are under pressure to improve their function s performance such as return on investment especially in digital technologies campaign effectiveness and customer engagement and retention throughout the entire brand experience using digital technology effectively to personalize how a company communicates with customers both before and after the purchase is going to be essential for the highperforming marketing organization current and future technologies such as network operations including mobile analytics cloud based content and customer experience platforms digital ad buying systems automation and ai give companies an enormous opportunity to tailor communications based on a person s or firm s demographics location past buying behavior and other data identifying prospects who are ready to buy personalizing the offers customizing ongoing post sale communications and suggesting new products are going to be key to creating a consistent brand experience that delights the customer in today s highly competitive marketplace and all are within marketers grasp but getting value from such marketing investments is not easy nor is measuring that value with confidence the cmo study was created to explore these challenges including how marketing organizations in large companies million in revenue or more are using digital technologies to personalize communications with prospects and customers specifically the survey was designed to get answers to the following questions ■ how many companies are digitally personalizing their communications and in what stages of the brand experience or customer lifecycle ■ what channels and data are they using most frequently to personalize such communications and how they personalizing those communications ■ what do the most effective marketers do differently than the trailing marketers in personalized communications do they emphasize certain phases of the brand experience certain communications channels over others certain types of data use analytics and ai more heavily or less heavily we also wanted to understand best practices in these companies by determining how leading marketers differed from trailing marketers in using digital technologies to personalize communications to do that we compared the survey responses of two groups leaders and followers determining those groups based on their answers to questions about the metrics they used how they fared on them and how accurate they thought their metrics were here is a preview of the initial findings for all surveys which focused on four stages of the customer lifecycle awareness conversion support and retention including for b2c which includes b2b2c and b2b companies and for leaders and followers this report shares initial findings for our survey of more than b2b and b2c enterprise cmos in north america and europe across every major industry the results are focused on four common stages of the customer journey awareness conversion support and retention initial key findingsmost marketing functions are not creating content for all four stages of the customer life cycleto create the optimal brand experience marketing departments should be involved in all four phases of the customer life cycle however when it comes to customer communications this is not the case as you can see in figure all marketing organizations are playing equally in the awareness stage with most also playing in the conversion stage but across all surveys less than half are are creating communications for customers in the support stage with doing so in the customer retention stage particularly in b2b companies how leaders differ from followers leaders marketing departments are more likely than those in followers to create communications for prospects and customers in stages and ■ stage conversion of leaders do so vs of followers ■ stage support of leaders vs of followers ■ stage retention of leaders vs of followers the findings from the survey population as a whole are based on the subset of marketing functions that personalize communications in each of the four stages in the awareness stage marketers use digital channels most frequently and personalize communications based on demographics more than other types of data every cmo surveyed said their marketing organization was involved in creating content to make its target market aware of its brand and products services this is no surprise it s the traditional role of marketing at least of marketers use the following channels to communicate to their marketplaces company website online video sites email digital media ads including paid search engine ads field outlets stores branches field offices however they still frequently use nondigital channels such as print media broadcast advertising and telemarketing this suggests that non digital marketing channels are still very much part of the cmo toolkit the most commonly used data to personalize those communications by far is demographic information used by nearly four out of five companies surveyed the second most frequently used data for personalized communications is web traffic data e g from using cookies on a web browser used by followed by using data on buying behavior obtained from other companies use this data in stage only about in companies use geo location data based on the physical proximity of people to a company s place of business from digital devices such as smartphones however the percentage is much higher for b2c companies at than for b2b companies only based on the data they have how are marketing functions personalizing communications the two most frequently cited ways were to provide useful product service information are doing this and give special offers and pricing however leading marketers are far more likely than followers to personalize communications with useful product service information most marketers involved in the conversion stage use digital data and digital channels to personalize communications to influence buying decisionsagain nearly three quarters of the marketers surveyed get involved in personalizing communications in stage traditionally the domain of sales organizations especially in b2b companies in fact of the b2c marketing heads we surveyed said marketing played a role in this stage of the customer lifecycle while less than half of b2b company marketing heads said the same thing for those marketers who are involved in personalizing marketing in stage their most frequently used channels are both digital and non digital in digital channels more than of this group uses digital media ads their firm s website email marketing and online video site but more than also use print media advertising and field outlets figure but what channels are most companies no longer using to convert prospects to customers today only are using direct mail and only about one in four uses a field sales force although of b2b companies still rely on them in terms of data to personalize communications marketers use demographic data more than any other type however of marketers today are using prospects geo location data to tailor communications although nearly all of this is from b2c companies than b2b companies only as in stage the majority personalizes communications with useful information on their products services and special deals and prices a minority tailors the graphic design of their communication or with relevant videos only use technology to show what their company s offerings would look like in the prospects environment e g furniture in a living room clothes on a person etc this is not surprising because many companies are not likely to have enough information on a prospect to show how their products would look in the customer s environment most marketers involved in post sale support personalize customer communications through their company website and emailas stated previously only of the marketing heads surveyed said their departments use digital technology to personalize content in stage post sale customer support but those that do far more frequently use their firm s websites and email support center to do this less than half create personalized communications that is distributed through their company s mobile apps a higher percentage of marketing departments personalize communications to be used by people in field outlets contact centers the firm s social media pages and in responses to social media comments see figure marketers that digitally personalize communications in post sale support have more relevant customer data they can use and many use it more than any other type of data about half of these companies use customers previous buying behavior with their firm yet much other data is still rarely being tapped here including geo location data used by only customer social media behavior customer product usage data from sensors embedded in their products or customer service usage data from sensors in the places in which they do business with customers the most common way that marketers use digital technologies to personalize communications for customers in post sale support is provide order status information done by of marketers more than half of marketers provide relevant product service information leaders are more than twice as likely than followers to provide such personalized information on their products services marketers involved in the customer retention stage use digital ads and their company website to personalize messagesa higher percentage of the marketers create content in stage than they do in stage their communications in stage are to trigger repeat purchases or new purchases from cross selling and upselling the marketing functions of consumer companies both b2c and b2b2c lead the way here it appears that in b2b companies the sales function controls customer communications only of the b2b companies surveyed said marketing is involved in digitally personalizing communications with customers after those prospects become customers this is in stark contrast to most consumer companies in which the majority of cmos surveyed in b2c said marketing plays a role in creating communications for existing customers in the hope of getting them to buy more products and services this was also a key way that marketing leaders b2c b2b and b2b2c were different than followers of leaders digitally personalize communications for customers in stage only of followers do so marketers that digitally personalize customer communications in this stage most frequently use two channels digital media ads used by and their website see figure the data they most commonly use is customers previous buying behavior with their firm use this and demographic data use this however only about one in four are using geolocation data to personalize communications the digital leaders in marketing are more likely to use such customer proximity data of them do it vs for followers but it s not much higher than average and only of marketers that digitally personalize communications in stage use customer web traffic data an even smaller percentage uses customer social media data so how do they digitally personalize such communications the most common ways are to provide relevant information on the product service recommend other offerings based on customer s purchasing behavior and offer special deals and prices by cmos expect that digital personalization of communications will be most important in attracting new customers not nurturing existing customersby next year more than two thirds of cmos predicted that digitally personalized communications will be more important in getting new customers stages and than in keeping and selling more to present customers stages and see figure only a third said the most important place for digitally personalized communications was stage said this or stage however leaders and followers answered this question very differently more than twice as many leaders as followers vs believe that in digitally personalized communications would be most important in stages or of the brand experience that is in creating messages for current customers not trying to attract new ones leaders and followers have a fundamental difference in personalizing pitches to prospects leaders don t focus on prices followers do for those that said stage will be the most important one to personalize communications in only of leaders said it was in tailoring offers and prices many more leaders said it was in providing useful product service information in contrast of followers said it was tailoring offers and prices and only said tailoring product service information excluding prices analytics are used most often to convert prospects to customers but far less often to retain customersa surprisingly low percentage of companies use analytics software to understand customer behavior in three of the four stages of the customer lifecycle stages and but especially in stages and when those companies likely have an abundance of digital information on their interactions with customers see figure however leaders more than followers use analytics to understand customer behavior in all four stages figure still the use of analytics to track prospects and customers in each of the four stages as well as throughout their lifecycle is the exception rather than the rule only about one in six of our survey respondents do that marketing activities are becoming heavily automated and shifting to public private cloudsto personalize thousands hundreds of thousands or millions of marketing messages to prospects and customers throughout the brand experience companies need to automate extensively any time a marketing person is needed to shift channels analyze which ones are working change graphic formats tweak messages including tailoring offers those marketing campaigns will slow down put simply for cmos to move to a world of marketing campaigns that self adjusts in real time to their channels offers copy graphics and other elements of personalization those marketing activities must be automated with artificial intelligence and other intelligent technologies the survey results suggest that most cmos feel the same way we asked our survey participants questions about the degree to which their marketing activities in five core areas were automated today ■ content and customer experience including content marketing and social media management platforms content creation tools etc ■ advertising including ad verification native or social advertising platforms ■ direct marketing management e g email marketing platforms lead management platforms ■ web operations e g personalization platforms search engine marketing optimization ■ data and analytics solutions e g digital marketing analytics tools marketing campaign dashboards the following numbers track the percentage of cmos that said the activities were totally or mostly manual vs those who said totally or mostly automated in those five technology domains in short there s already a fairly high degree on average of automation see figure we also asked them to predict the extent to which those activities would be automated by the short answer cmos expect to increase automation significantly over the next year see figure but the aggressive drive to personalize content to ever higher degrees throughout the customer lifecycle can be seen in other ways making real time automated personalized content changes to identify prospects and entice them to buy or get customers to buy more and remain loyal customers companies need enormous amounts of computing power as such content becomes more digital intensive think digital videos and as the communications channels increasingly become mobile digital devices especially on the smartphone cmos need immense computational resources on demand increasingly this amount of computing power is beyond the capabilities that most large companies have in their data centers even some of the largest companies this is the reason that public private and hybrid cloud companies that offer infinite computing power are growing by leaps and bounds to assess the degree to which marketing software applications and technology infrastructure was running on companies on premises data centers vs those of public and or private cloud companies we asked cmos to roughly estimate those percentages figure about half of their applications and it infrastructure runs onpremises now but they estimated that of their marketing technology stack will run in public and or private clouds by next year conclusionthis is the initial analysis of our extensive research findings we are continuing to conduct qualitative best practice interviews and mining the data to see key differences between leaders and followers

80,this report is based on tcs larger study on digital marketing opportunities for cmos in global industries our findings are based on just one part of the study how marketers are using digital technology to personalize the way they communicate with prospects in what we refer to as the first stage of the brand experience this is the awareness stage one of four retailers far more frequently than all survey respondents said marketing creates communications in stage of the brand experience getting current customers to buy more offerings about three quarters of retail marketers do that vs less than half of all survey participants key findings in stage creating market awareness how retail marketers personalize communications to attract the digitally distracted digital channels dominate and social media is a key tool every retailer creates awareness of its offerings through both digital and non digital channels including print media so print newspapers and magazines are still key marketing vehicles fewer retailers but still a majority use broadcast media and more than two thirds use their social media presence to reel in prospects some of the retail cmos we surveyed use print media advertising to attract the attention of potential customers that compares with of the survey population as a whole and of retail marketers advertise in broadcast channels again higher than all industries however not one retailer uses direct mail marketing but digital channels are crucial retailers were much more likely to use their mobile apps to snare the attention of prospective customers some of retailers use their apps as a channel for creating awareness vs of all companies surveyed other research confirms the value of retailers apps among several categories of apps that it studied retail and ecommerce apps enjoyed the highest retention rates of users worldwide in the second half of last year according to localytics about two thirds of retailers use their social media pages to get their messages out savvy retailers go another step they use social media to interact online with prospects for example u s home improvement retail giant lowes replies to consumers who ask questions on the firm s facebook pages and according to one article they aren t formulaic responses as of april lowes had more than million facebook followers about of retailers use their apps to create awareness vs of all companies surveyed about one quarter run digital ads on e commerce sites such as amazon com that number was the same as the entire survey population this might sound surprising a retailer running ads on another retailer s e commerce site but other research shows it is not unusual a survey conducted this year found retailers with at least million in online revenue spend an average of their digital ad budgets on amazon 3a much higher percentage of retailers than survey population as a whole uses ads on online review forums such as yelp google and others retailers latch on to social media and geo location data retail marketers are more likely than survey respondents as a whole to use data for personalizing communications to create awareness of their offerings most retailers use demographic data followed by social media behavior and website traffic data to personalize their marketing messages retailers are also much more attentive to using social media behavior to personalize messages some of retail marketers use this data vs for the survey population overall one reason is that the products retailers sell are highly tangible and can attract consumer attention for example lowes in began running short videos on the social site vine about how to fix things around the home the video ads were meant to help consumers believe they can make the repairs and thus increase the chances of selling products that lowes sells often people are intimated by home improvement the company s cmo at the time told a reporter lowes extensively uses facebook pinterest and other social media as well about four out of retailers are using geo location data to personalize their communications with prospects this is a crucial piece of data for retailers to use especially given more and moreconsumers are buying products online that means those who are out and about and are close to a retailer s store become bigger targets retailers more often push useful info not price the last question we asked retailers on how they personalize marketing in stage of the brand experience was about the kind of information they provide to prospects based on the data they have about a potential customer surprisingly more retailers furnished useful information than hawked special deals and prices how lowes uses social media – to not only display its products but also to engage online customers – provides testimony to the value of helping consumers online not just promoting products and services digital gives us ways to connect more deeply with our customers than traditional media ever could lowes cmo jocelyn wong said we can be there throughout the customer journey in many different ways and across many different moments we re able to create more value more often and engage on a more personal level the retailers we surveyed provided additional evidence of the power of digital marketing at the very start of a new customer relationship when a retail brand is trying to reel in a new customer to its stores more retailers provided useful information than special deals and prices demographics tcs surveyed chief marketing officers at retailers in

stage of the brand experience creating awareness is one of four stages stay tuned for more reports about what tth marketers are doing in the other three stages not surprisingly all tth companies we surveyed have marketing programs in stage however when we asked whether marketing creates communications in the other three stages those percentages fell off significantly see figure key findings in

industry said their company uses four digital marketing channels digital ads their own websites email marketing and online video sites the clear majority also has social media site pages a much higher than average percentage than the industries we surveyed of whose companies created awareness through their social media company pages digital media ads today on the big travel book sites are crucial for many companies in this industry see figure but non digital media are still important for the majority of firms outbound contact centers field outlets i e travel agencies field sales forces billboards and print advertising however direct mail marketing used by none of the firms and broadcast media used by only about one third are not frequently used marketing channels in stage for all survey respondents use broadcast media and so travel transportation and hospitality firms as a whole rely far less on that marketing channel travel marketers are not fully on the digital data trail for personalizing communications so what data do travel related marketers use to personalize communications to individual prospects by far the highest percentage of them use demographic data which has long been in use before and after digital channels emerged in the 1990s coming in a distant second used by is data on online users past buying behavior with other companies for example for a rental car company somebody booking an airline flight is a prime prospect for dangling a rental car deal see figure less than a third are using web traffic to their own websites to personalize what they present to prospects and only about one in four personalizes communications based on a prospect s social media comments that is far less than the industry average and less than half of the retail industry average personalizing interactions with consumers on a travel company s social media pages e g facebook could be new frontier for many travel marketers who want to turn prospects into customers only one in five travel industry marketers uses geo location data to personalize communications in the awareness stage of the brand experience such data which smartphones can provide if

to target ads only in travel industry marketers uses geo location data to personalize communications in the awareness stage of the brand experience personalized marketing usually means special offers people booking travel are often ready to book when they go online travel marketers know this and their marketing messages usually comes armed with deals the most frequent way that travel marketers digitally personalize communications with individuals to create awareness of their offerings is to pitch special deals and prices of the travel marketers we survey do this see figure close behind by of those surveyed was providing useful product or service information again personalized to the individual based on data the travel marketer has about that individual more than one third are tailoring the graphic design colors images used etc of their personalized digital promotions to prospects and provide relevant videos to prospects based on some data they have about them e g the web surfer looking for vacation hotels in paris who is shown a hotelier s digital ad with a video of the premises the most frequent way that travel marketers digitally personalize communications with individuals to create awareness of their offerings is to pitch special deals and prices of the travel marketers we survey do this demographics we surveyed companies in north america and europe in the travel

geographies this information can enable additional drill down to decide on risk mitigation actions like stay at home mandates or remote work facilities using the geography hierarchy the cmo can drill down a point of view to the state or county level risk exposure that an employee may be subjected to due to his or her presence at that location health risks while employees are impacted by risks associated with a location based infection outbreak certain preexisting health conditions make an employee even more vulnerable using the data around voluntarily disclosed recent travel and prevailing

enabled roles in many cases like personnel handling cash distribution in atms or essential services providers few employees will need to continue to work from office locations or to travel to service locations this data will need to be captured within the hcm system and can be utilized by the cmo in agreement with line managers or supervisors and hr officers to determine the remaining set of the employees who can be advised to work from remote location in isolation a point of view it is important to note that not all types of work can be done with the same level of efficiency from remote
