            "<p><b>Peter Drucker, the legendary management scholar and consultant, noted in a 1994 </b><i><b>Harvard Business Review</b></i><b> article that the assumptions businesses make—about customer behaviors, competitors, and markets—constitute their theory of business.</b><sup><b><a name=\"sdendnote1anc\"></a><sup>1</sup></b></sup><b> The theory that a company develops, dictates what it should do and how it should do it, and can be a powerful tool to guide the enterprise.</b></p>\n",
            "<p>However, when those assumptions no longer reflect reality, the decisions a company makes that once led to profitability can lead it astray. The failure to change the theory (and the assumptions that undergird it) to align with the new reality, Drucker wrote, is at the root of all business crises.</p>\n",
            "<p>Today, because customer behaviors, markets, and competitors have all changed, and continue to change rapidly, business theories do not reflect reality for very long. This is why so many companies, especially those most affected by the digitization of everything, are in crisis. It is why they need to revise their theories of business to become smarter, faster, and lighter.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>The Revolution in Customer Behavior</b></p>\n",
            "<p>How much have business theories changed over this decade? Look at one aspect of customer behavior—the shopping patterns of consumers. Just a few years ago, when a shopper entered a store, his or her choice was limited to what was on the shelves. Today, armed with smart mobile devices, enabled by free, pervasive WiFi, a customer in Store A can:</p>\n",
            "<ul>\n",
            "<li><p>Compare the price and quality of what is on the shelves with an entire universe of competing products</p>\n",
            "</li>\n",
            "<li><p>Obtain instant reviews of products from social media channels</p>\n",
            "</li>\n",
            "<li><p>Text friends about their experiences with the products, or ask trusted strangers in online consumer forums</p>\n",
            "</li>\n",
            "<li><p>Purchase the product from Store B while standing in Store A’s aisle</p>\n",
            "</li>\n",
            "</ul>\n",
            "<p>This complex path to purchase promises to grow more varied, not less. According to a 2014 study, 22% of shoppers interacted digitally prior to shopping. While only 4% used a digital device during the shopping process, 75% said they planned to do so in the near future.<sup><a name=\"sdendnote2anc\"></a><sup>2</sup></sup> Just one year later, U.S. car buyers spent 60% of their time purchasing a vehicle doing online research. By the time they went to a dealer, 71% decided to buy the car they intended to purchase. If companies want to influence the customer’s purchase, they need to do it much earlier in the so-called customer journey.<sup><a name=\"sdendnote3anc\"></a><sup>3</sup></sup></p>\n",
            "<p>A theory of business based on a static, linear customer journey, or one that prescribes a rigid customer experience, no longer reflects reality.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>The Digitally Shifting Competitive Landscape</b></p>\n",
            "<p>Traditionally, a company’s growth strategy was to become the market leader in its core market segments, and then protect that position against competitors. But that does not account for the fact that competitors now emerge from different segments. In 2001, for example, Nokia was the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It had a robust, well-funded R&amp;D function, and seemingly unassailable scale. In 2004, it still had over a third of the market.<sup><a name=\"sdendnote4anc\"></a><sup>4</sup></sup></p>\n",
            "<p>After Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 and Google’s Android operating system came online the next year, Nokia’s theory of the business became instantly obsolete.</p>\n",
            "<p>Nokia was not defeated by another cell phone maker. It lost market share to a computer company and an online firm. Apple and Google developed technologies with an ecosystem that used the network effect, which made them valuable in the eyes of the consumers.<sup><a name=\"sdendnote5anc\"></a><sup>5</sup></sup></p>\n",
            "<p>A theory of business that fails to account for competitors emerging from entirely different sectors of the economy no longer reflects the reality of global competition. Due to powerful and fast-evolving technologies, easy access to capital, and lower barriers to entry, companies need to look beyond their segments and geographies to keep a weather eye out for fast-emerging competitors.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>The Metamorphosis of Markets</b></p>\n",
            "<p>Nokia’s size did not protect it. Indeed, scale, long an axiomatic part of strategies designed to dominate markets, has become less important and sometimes burdensome. In part, this is due to the increasing power of emerging markets. By 2025, it is estimated that developing economies could account for nearly 70% of global demand for manufactured goods.<sup><a name=\"sdendnote6anc\"></a><sup>6</sup></sup></p>\n",
            "<p>Increasingly, this shift in demand is forcing companies to personalize their offerings for markets by focusing on regional production, as have been the strategies of IKEA, P&amp;G, Emerson, and others. This new reality can be seen clearly in the pharmaceutical sector. Large regulatory agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medical Agency have been promulgating faster approvals of new, personalized medicines for unmet medical needs in small patient populations. To take advantage of these new pathways, drug developers must be able to respond rapidly to guidance from regulators.</p>\n",
            "<p>Smaller, more agile companies, unburdened by outdated workflows and less top-heavy, can make faster decisions and take advantage of regulator input more quickly than larger companies.</p>\n",
            "<p>These small companies, with one or two drugs in their pipelines, can achieve enormous market valuations in short times. They move faster because they are much lighter organizations than big pharma.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>How to Get Smarter, Faster, and Lighter</b></p>\n",
            "<p>How can companies change their theories of business to become smarter, faster, and lighter at the speed of these digitally driven transformations? We explain how to do it in the three sections of this edition of <i>Perspectives</i>.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>Getting Smarter</b></p>\n",
            "<p>One of the themes of this section is that companies must harness artificial intelligence (AI). TCS’ Harrick Vin explains two key challenges that AI poses to companies. In our interview with Dartmouth Professor Vijay Govindarajan, he discusses how to accelerate culture changes of the type that digital technology is forcing companies to make.</p>\n",
            "<p>TCS’ Satya Ramaswamy’s 2016 <i>Harvard Business Review</i> article, reprinted here in <i>Perspectives</i>, explains one big change that nearly every company will have to make over the rest of the decade to get smarter—listening and acting quickly upon the digital data that is streaming in from the wireless sensors they have installed in their products. Whether your company makes cars, coffee machines, or barbecues, it must give special treatment to such Internet of Things data that shows how your products are performing for customers.</p>\n",
            "<p>We also profile The Associated Press, the 170-year-old news service that has been using AI to produce quarterly earnings stories without dedicating staff to write them. By the end of 2015, the software was generating 3,700 quarterly earnings stories covering all listed U.S. companies (and some in Canada). That has freed up AP’s human workforce to do the deeper enterprise reporting its member newspapers need.</p>\n",
            "<p>However, getting smarter through AI forces companies to get far better at analyzing the digital data that is coursing through their data centers. In her article, TCS’ Lipika Dey explains the new tools for doing such crucial analytics. Our interview with University of Texas at Austin Professor Prabhudev Konana explores the metrics and skills necessary for analytics to have impact in an organization.</p>\n",
            "<p>Finally, in this section the head of TCS’ banking &amp; financial services practice, K. Krithivasan, explains how banks and financial services firm are using analytics to make better decisions.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>Getting Faster</b></p>\n",
            "<p>As Tonya McKinney and Dave Anderson explain in their article on dynamic customer journeys, companies must design their customer journeys to respond to changes faster. They must also change their journeys in an agile, iterative fashion by monitoring every consumer channel, and every touch point, continuously.</p>\n",
            "<p>TCS’ Sunder Singh and Akhilesh Tiwari discuss in their article how global companies are getting faster at implementing enterprise systems. Ajoy Mukerjee, TCS’ global head and vice president of human resources, explores how big companies can identify the key talent they will need long before others do.</p>\n",
            "<p>Companies need to turn uncertainty about who the new competitors may be into their advantage, as CEO consultant Ram Charan explains in our interview with him. Our case study on Microsoft’s embrace of machine learning shows how companies can gain share (for instance, the search engine market) by adopting new approaches to enhance digital products.</p>\n",
            "<p>At the end of this section, the heads of TCS’ retail (Pratik Pal) and life sciences practices (Debashis Ghosh) explain how companies are getting quicker at understanding their performance for customers and integrating acquisitions.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>Getting Lighter</b></p>\n",
            "<p>To get lighter, companies need to embrace technologies that reduce their IT burden and costs, such as cloud computing, automation, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). At the same time, they should seek expertise of third parties without having to inflate their workforces. This is what Nidhi Srivastava, global head of IT consulting at TCS, examines in her article.</p>\n",
            "<p>Getting lighter places even greater demands on companies that make multiple acquisitions. They need to quickly integrate the operations of their newly purchased companies—for example, in six months rather than years, as TCS’ vice president of business consulting Dave Jordan lays out in his article. Merging IT-intensive operations is one of the best ways for two companies to shed excess weight—business processes, applications, hardware, and other infrastructure that are no longer necessary when one company is taken over by another.</p>\n",
            "<p><b>Companies that can profit from changing environments, and are built to incorporate continuous transformations, will be the ones all of us will be doing business with tomorrow and for the foreseeable future.</b></p>\n",
            "<p>In our interview with Professor Jeanne Ross of the MIT Sloan School, she explains how digital companies are able to move at the speed of light and the lessons for established companies that now must become digital.</p>\n",
            "<p>Big data tool provider Cloudera is using its own technology to identify the changes its customers must make on the systems it runs for them, as its chief strategy officer, Mike Olson, explains in the case study on the company. And the head of TCS’ manufacturing practice, Milind Lakkad, explains how manufacturers can lighten up their operations while remaining world-class.</p>\n",

        " support them. \n",
        "\n",
        "The work begins by understanding the condition of the company's digital data. The company needs to ascertain whether it has all the data needed to create insights and to make changes in the business based on those insights. It must also determine what data\n",
        " is missing and where it might be collected - including from external sources such as business partners. For example, wireless telecommunications companies struggle to retain customers in a competitive market. They can use internal data to analyze network usage\n",

        "Today,\n",
        " companies that wish to excel at analytics are largely dependent on people with advanced analysis capabilities to manage data, create algorithms, and take other steps to turn data into insight. However, this is inadequate in the current dataabundant environment.\n",
        " Data is growing so fast that hiring and training enough analytics experts to keep up with the onslaught of information is realistically impossible. Depending on a core of analytics experts inevitably will create bottlenecks, preventing an organization from\n",
        " scaling its use of data.\n",
        "Instead, companies must democratize analytics, with data tools available to people with varying degrees of analytics expertise at all levels of the organization.\n",
        "Companies today have numerous people without PhDs in statistics or data science but who have deep familiarity with customers and business processes. In many enterprises, they are an underutilized resource in generating\n",
        " insights from data. Rectifying this gap requires both training and new technologies (some of which are already available) that make analytics technologies simpler and more accessible.\n",
        "Crowdsourcing is another way to overcome internal skills shortages in analytics. Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble have held online crowdsourcing contests that ask people outside their organizations for help\n",
        " in solving technical challenges.\n",
        "Applications of data-intensive VR (virtual reality) technology can make complicated data sets comprehensible to technicians and even customers. Lowe's, the large home improvement retail chain in the U.S., is experimenting\n",

        "Overcoming Barriers to Capitalizing on Analytics\n",
        "To take advantage of\n",
        " the insight economy, companies need to avoid several pitfalls. Above all, the organization needs to master change. Capitalizing on analytics demands a complete overhaul of the organization's culture at every level. It's a matter of moving from intuition to\n",

        "This transition is challenging and requires a comprehensive change management effort. Business users require education and practice in using tools and the products of data analysis. They must learn that data\n",
        " can show correlations about business trends that are more precise, and actionable, than their gut instincts. (Because these users bring great resources of institutional knowledge, the training is well worth the investment.) Training should continue as the\n",
        " company's analytics maturity advances; for example, when a firm implements more technologies to automate analytics production, that will require users to adjust (and carry out more advanced tasks).\n",
        "Becoming a data-driven organization requires coaching and practice, too. Everyone in the company needs to understand the importance of the effort and their role in its success. To ensure that the transformation is successful,\n",
        " employees need to embrace idea that the company's data is not \"owned\" by any one function but that all share ownership and responsibility for making good use of it. In some organizations, those who led data efforts in recent past, such as the CIO or chief\n",
        " data officer, now need to collaborate extensively with other functions to make the best use of their singular expertise. In particular, data and analytics experts must work with domain and contextual experts to maximize the benefits of analytics. This will\n",
        " democratize the use of data and the creation of business value from it.\n",
        "Data management and ownership issues can pose major internal barriers to analytics adoption. Data that is held captive and not shared across the organization can impede progress. On the other end of the spectrum, companies\n",

        " and other elements of regulatory compliance. In pursuing the opportunities posed by analytics, the company must attend to the growing body of data privacy statutes and anticipate regulatory changes. Both the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation\n",
        " (GDPR), which went into effect in May 2018, and California's recently enacted Consumer Privacy Act (CPA), which will take effect in 2020, include strict provisions and prescribe heavy fines for violations.31 Data security, meanwhile, requires extra\n",

        "These regulatory statutes apply to organizations doing business in their jurisdictions and processing the personal data of their residents, regardless of where the businesses may be headquartered. Companies should continue\n",
        " to monitor regulatory environments in all areas of the globe where they do business and ensure they thoroughly understand how their data is being used while planning for future statutory developments.\n",
        "Clearly, implementing analytics (just as with any technology) is not a panacea for every business problem. In addition to selecting the right technologies and tools, success requires a commitment to culture change, investments\n",
        " in skills, and revamping business processes. Implementation, and the transformation it produces, is about people and processes as well as technology.\n",

        "For finance executives, the digital transformation isn't coming. It's already arrived.\n",
        "Or they need to act as if it is, anyway. While their companies may still be working on prioritizing and procuring the necessary technology, CFOs need to make sure that the organization's future shape can accommodate - and maximize - emerging technologies\n",
        " such as Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things. In their evolving role as strategists, they must prematurely visualize a reconfigured finance function, one that seamlessly aligns advances in technology with the acquisition of newly critical skills.\n",
        "The task of rethinking the function, even in the face of fast-moving, high-impact technological changes, doesn't require CFOs to abandon their methodological ways. They can't begin to reconstruct the function without first laying the supporting groundwork.\n",
        "How to go about doing so is discussed in the chapters that follow, which reflect the results of a survey conducted by CFO Research, in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services, that explored many different aspects of digital maturity and leadership.\n",
        "Even as they steer the finance function into the unfamiliar terrain of the future, CFOs must make sure that it can withstand the challenges. What finance leaders need to do includes: Modernizing the function to \"Business 4.0,\" making the shift to digital\n",
        " technology (Chapter 1); Adopting a Machine-First model, aligning human skills and technological advances to support digital growth (Chapter 2); Becoming catalysts for growth, actively adopting strategies, technologies, and agile business models (Chapter 3).\n",
        "As their role shifts from record-keepers to emissaries from the digital future, senior finance executives will inevitably become both explorers and innovators.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chapter One: Finance Chiefs Redefine the Art of Possible with Business 4.0\n",
        "Business is poised to dive into an immersive digital future, powered by a convergence of innovative technologies-the cloud, mobile, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI), among others-that will require finance executives to rethink\n",
        " every aspect of their businesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "To thrive in this fast-changing era, companies will have to do more than retrofit existing processes to accommodate new technology; the challenge of Business 4.0 is to leverage the digital shift to transform and grow. Companies that cannot successfully integrate\n",
        " technology, embedding it throughout their business - from the supply chain to the customer experience to operational processes - risk quickly becoming commoditized.\n",
        "No longer is it enough to acquire and implement advanced technological capabilities; in Business 4.0, the marketplace leaders will be those companies that identify how best to integrate new technologies to deliver added value. With the accelerating inflow\n",
        " of emerging technologies like Blockchain and the Internet of Things, maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage requires developing the capacity to continually drive digital capabilities. The goal: to produce visible benefits in both performance metrics\n",
        " and financial results.\n",
        "No matter what industry they operate in, most companies have by now embarked on digital initiatives. But as they sort through the technical issues, they must also confront the managerial challenges of allowing and enabling digital innovation to scale: allocating\n",
        " resources, recruiting and incentivizing talent that will drive technical advances, as well as aligning functions such as marketing and product development. For finance leaders, the new digital mandate requires that they make strategically selective investments,\n",
        " balancing leading-edge technologies with those that are sufficiently mature and reliable to produce the desired benefits. No sooner have companies absorbed the cloud and cybersecurity into their infrastructures then they must immediately begin incubating newer\n",
        " arrivals.\n",
        "Why the urgency? In its comparatively brief-but-memorable history, the phenomenon known as disruption has repeatedly rumbled through established industries and architectures, hollowing out legacy business models before established market leaders had time\n",
        " to react. By the time a brand-name company like Blockbuster recognized that it was being disrupted by Netflix, its market cap had utterly unwound.\n",
        "The disruptors gain competitive advantage from crafting their business models around a vision of the future of digitization. The new incumbents got where they are by conceptualizing their business models in alignment with the digital experiences they sought\n",
        " to deliver. Uber doesn't own any cars but is the largest cab company in the world. Similarly, Amazon doesn't hold any inventory but manages one of the world's most successful online retail sites, connecting the consumer with the seller on a unique platform\n",
        " and configuring logistics to meet consumer needs while surpassing their pricing expectations.\n",
        "For their companies to thrive in the digitized economy, CFOs need to become scouts, exploring future technologies and piecing together a vision of the end-state business model. With that blueprint as their guide, they then must help map out a route for how\n",
        " the company will arrive at the desired outcome. More than managers, CFOs must become leaders who can persuasively communicate the purpose of the digital shift and empower the company's employees to contribute.\n",
        "\n",

        "Business\n",

        "Governance,\n",

        " (SSCs)? Should the business broaden the scope and sophistication of the processes it moves to the SSCs? Can finance use some of what it has learned from its own experience with digital technology to apply those lessons to optimizing the performance of processes?\n",
        "Organizational\n",
        " Alignment: Beyond the implementation of digital tools, achieving transformation requires the imposition of a collective mindset that emphasizes collaboration and communication. Depending on the company, the finance leader will have to identify a structure\n",

        " centralizing, and re-engineering business processes - CFOs have now been elevated to act as advisors and coaches to top management.\n",
        "Rather than simply allocating resources to new technology, the most proactive finance executives now apply a business-based perspective to assessing the potential of digital technology. Implementation must be grounded in achieving specific results and outcomes,\n",
        " from driving better-informed decisions to managing risk more effectively. By consistently drawing a clear connection between strategy and financial performance, they keep the company in alignment. Like technology, the role of the CFO has expanded from being\n",

        "Fulfilling that role, at a time when business architectures are rapidly evolving, means becoming, to borrow a skill often ascribed to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, \"explainer-in-chief\" It's no longer enough for CFOs to capture the company's condition\n",
        " by assembling traditional accounting metrics; they now need to explain changes in the customer base and marketplace. Backed up by data, they need to articulate the gap between how management currently sees the company and how it should be looking at the business.\n",

        "CFOs as Catalysts\n",
        "Strategic CFOs can take a broad range of actions to support growth. Unlike the compliance and control-oriented activities they focused on in the past, they now need to focus on implementing strategic, high-value components of a successful growth plan.\n",
        "The most significant responsibilities they can assume in that regard include ensuring that data/analytics are being used strategically as well as getting involved in the development of next-generation business models (e.g., Business 4.0). As part of the\n",

            "peter drucker, the legendary management scholar and consultant, noted in a 1994 harvard business review article that the assumptions businesses make—about customer behaviors, competitors, and markets—constitute their theory of business.1 the theory that a company develops, dictates what it should do and how it should do it, and can be a powerful tool to guide the enterprise.however, when those assumptions no longer reflect reality, the decisions a company makes that once led to profitability can lead it astray. the failure to change the theory (and the assumptions that undergird it) to align with the new reality, drucker wrote, is at the root of all business crises.today, because customer behaviors, markets, and competitors have all changed, and continue to change rapidly, business theories do not reflect reality for very long. this is why so many companies, especially those most affected by the digitization of everything, are in crisis. it is why they need to revise their theories of business to become smarter, faster, and lighter.the revolution in customer behaviorhow much have business theories changed over this decade? look at one aspect of customer behavior—the shopping patterns of consumers. just a few years ago, when a shopper entered a store, his or her choice was limited to what was on the shelves. today, armed with smart mobile devices, enabled by free, pervasive wifi, a customer in store a can:compare the price and quality of what is on the shelves with an entire universe of competing productsobtain instant reviews of products from social media channelstext friends about their experiences with the products, or ask trusted strangers in online consumer forumspurchase the product from store b while standing in store a’s aislethis complex path to purchase promises to grow more varied, not less. according to a 2014 study, 22% of shoppers interacted digitally prior to shopping. while only 4% used a digital device during the shopping process, 75% said they planned to do so in the near future.2 just one year later, u.s. car buyers spent 60% of their time purchasing a vehicle doing online research. by the time they went to a dealer, 71% decided to buy the car they intended to purchase. if companies want to influence the customer’s purchase, they need to do it much earlier in the so-called customer journey.3a theory of business based on a static, linear customer journey, or one that prescribes a rigid customer experience, no longer reflects reality.the digitally shifting competitive landscapetraditionally, a company’s growth strategy was to become the market leader in its core market segments, and then protect that position against competitors. but that does not account for the fact that competitors now emerge from different segments. in 2001, for example, nokia was the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world. it had a robust, well-funded r&d function, and seemingly unassailable scale. in 2004, it still had over a third of the market.4after apple launched the iphone in 2007 and google’s android operating system came online the next year, nokia’s theory of the business became instantly obsolete.nokia was not defeated by another cell phone maker. it lost market share to a computer company and an online firm. apple and google developed technologies with an ecosystem that used the network effect, which made them valuable in the eyes of the consumers.5a theory of business that fails to account for competitors emerging from entirely different sectors of the economy no longer reflects the reality of global competition. due to powerful and fast-evolving technologies, easy access to capital, and lower barriers to entry, companies need to look beyond their segments and geographies to keep a weather eye out for fast-emerging competitors.the metamorphosis of marketsnokia’s size did not protect it. indeed, scale, long an axiomatic part of strategies designed to dominate markets, has become less important and sometimes burdensome. in part, this is due to the increasing power of emerging markets. by 2025, it is estimated that developing economies could account for nearly 70% of global demand for manufactured goods.6increasingly, this shift in demand is forcing companies to personalize their offerings for markets by focusing on regional production, as have been the strategies of ikea, p&g, emerson, and others. this new reality can be seen clearly in the pharmaceutical sector. large regulatory agencies like the u.s. food and drug administration and the european medical agency have been promulgating faster approvals of new, personalized medicines for unmet medical needs in small patient populations. to take advantage of these new pathways, drug developers must be able to respond rapidly to guidance from regulators.smaller, more agile companies, unburdened by outdated workflows and less top-heavy, can make faster decisions and take advantage of regulator input more quickly than larger companies.these small companies, with one or two drugs in their pipelines, can achieve enormous market valuations in short times. they move faster because they are much lighter organizations than big pharma.how to get smarter, faster, and lighterhow can companies change their theories of business to become smarter, faster, and lighter at the speed of these digitally driven transformations? we explain how to do it in the three sections of this edition of perspectives.getting smarterone of the themes of this section is that companies must harness artificial intelligence (ai). tcs’ harrick vin explains two key challenges that ai poses to companies. in our interview with dartmouth professor vijay govindarajan, he discusses how to accelerate culture changes of the type that digital technology is forcing companies to make.tcs’ satya ramaswamy’s 2016 harvard business review article, reprinted here in perspectives, explains one big change that nearly every company will have to make over the rest of the decade to get smarter—listening and acting quickly upon the digital data that is streaming in from the wireless sensors they have installed in their products. whether your company makes cars, coffee machines, or barbecues, it must give special treatment to such internet of things data that shows how your products are performing for customers.we also profile the associated press, the 170-year-old news service that has been using ai to produce quarterly earnings stories without dedicating staff to write them. by the end of 2015, the software was generating 3,700 quarterly earnings stories covering all listed u.s. companies (and some in canada). that has freed up ap’s human workforce to do the deeper enterprise reporting its member newspapers need.however, getting smarter through ai forces companies to get far better at analyzing the digital data that is coursing through their data centers. in her article, tcs’ lipika dey explains the new tools for doing such crucial analytics. our interview with university of texas at austin professor prabhudev konana explores the metrics and skills necessary for analytics to have impact in an organization.finally, in this section the head of tcs’ banking & financial services practice, k. krithivasan, explains how banks and financial services firm are using analytics to make better decisions.getting fasteras tonya mckinney and dave anderson explain in their article on dynamic customer journeys, companies must design their customer journeys to respond to changes faster. they must also change their journeys in an agile, iterative fashion by monitoring every consumer channel, and every touch point, continuously.tcs’ sunder singh and akhilesh tiwari discuss in their article how global companies are getting faster at implementing enterprise systems. ajoy mukerjee, tcs’ global head and vice president of human resources, explores how big companies can identify the key talent they will need long before others do.companies need to turn uncertainty about who the new competitors may be into their advantage, as ceo consultant ram charan explains in our interview with him. our case study on microsoft’s embrace of machine learning shows how companies can gain share (for instance, the search engine market) by adopting new approaches to enhance digital products.at the end of this section, the heads of tcs’ retail (pratik pal) and life sciences practices (debashis ghosh) explain how companies are getting quicker at understanding their performance for customers and integrating acquisitions.getting lighterto get lighter, companies need to embrace technologies that reduce their it burden and costs, such as cloud computing, automation, and software-as-a-service (saas). at the same time, they should seek expertise of third parties without having to inflate their workforces. this is what nidhi srivastava, global head of it consulting at tcs, examines in her article.getting lighter places even greater demands on companies that make multiple acquisitions. they need to quickly integrate the operations of their newly purchased companies—for example, in six months rather than years, as tcs’ vice president of business consulting dave jordan lays out in his article. merging it-intensive operations is one of the best ways for two companies to shed excess weight—business processes, applications, hardware, and other infrastructure that are no longer necessary when one company is taken over by another.companies that can profit from changing environments, and are built to incorporate continuous transformations, will be the ones all of us will be doing business with tomorrow and for the foreseeable future.in our interview with professor jeanne ross of the mit sloan school, she explains how digital companies are able to move at the speed of light and the lessons for established companies that now must become digital.big data tool provider cloudera is using its own technology to identify the changes its customers must make on the systems it runs for them, as its chief strategy officer, mike olson, explains in the case study on the company. and the head of tcs’ manufacturing practice, milind lakkad, explains how manufacturers can lighten up their operations while remaining world-class.1. harvard business
